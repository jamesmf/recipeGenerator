RED BEANS AND RICE


1  lb. red beans
2  cloves garlic, minced
2  Tbsp. chopped parsley
  black pepper, sea salt and Tabasco to taste
1  large yellow onion, grated
2  ribs celery, chopped
1  or 2 large bay leaves

      Rinse and sort the beans.  Soak them overnight in 8 to 10 cups of cold water; do not change the water.  Bring the water to a soft boil.  As the water heats, mince the garlic and chop the celery, then saut them.  Add all with parsley, onion, bay leaves and seasonings to beans.  Cover and boil gently, stirring occasionally, for 2 to 3 hours.  It will thicken as the water reduces.  The last hour or so, you may wish to remove the lid.  Serve over rice.
