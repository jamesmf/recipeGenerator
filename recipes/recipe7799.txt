MEAT BALLS


1  lb. ground beef
2  slices bread or 2 stale rolls, crumbled
1  egg
1  pkg. meat loaf seasoning (may use salt, pepper, dry mustard and onion powder)
1/2  c. water
1  can tomato sauce (for topping after cooking)

      Mix all ingredients. Make into balls and bake at about 400 degrees; in a single layer in a baking pan. Drain off grease and place in casserole. Cover with tomato sauce and place in 300 degrees; oven. Heat to simmer.
      Excellent to freeze without sauce. Double recipe for quick meals (put into plastic containers).
