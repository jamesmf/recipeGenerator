AVOCADO SALSA


1  can (4.5-oz.) diced mild green chiles
2  large ripe tomatoes (about 1 lb. total)
1  fresh jalapeno chile, seeded and finely chopped
2  Tbsp. fresh lime juice
2  garlic cloves, peeled and minced
1  tsp. salt
2  ripe California avocados, pitted, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch chunks
1/3  c. finely diced red onion
1/3  c. finely chopped cilantro

      Halve the tomatoes crosswise and gently squeeze out and discard the liquid and seeds.  Coarsely chop the tomatoes.  In a blender or food processor, combine the tomatoes, jalapenos, lime juice, garlic, and salt and pulse several times.  Transfer the puree to a bowl and stir in the green chiles, avocado chunks, onions, and cilantro.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.  Best if eaten within an hour or so of preparation.
