SKILLET SWEET POTATOES



1  lb. sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced*
1/2  tsp. finely shredded orange peel
1/2  c. orange juice
1  Tbsp. molasses or brown sugar
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. ground cinnamon
1/8  tsp. ground allspice

      Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in skillet.  Add sweet potatoes; reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until tender.  Drain.  In a small bowl, combine orange peel, orange juice, molasses or brown sugar, salt, cinnamon and allspice and pour over potatoes.  Cook and stir gently until bubbly.  Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until potatoes are glazed, spooning sauce over potatoes occasionally.  Makes 4 servings.
      Note:  Can substitute 1 (18 ounce) can sweet potatoes for fresh.  Cut potatoes into 2-inch pieces and place in 1-quart casserole.  Pour sauce over sweet potatoes and bake, uncovered, in a 350 degrees; oven about 30 minutes or until heated through and sauce is bubbly.
