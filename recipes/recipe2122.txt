STRAWBERRY CANDIES


1 (15 oz.)  can sweetened condensed milk
1  lb. flaked coconut, finely ground
2 (3 oz.)  pkg. strawberry flavored gelatin, divided
1  c. finely ground almonds
1  Tbsp. sugar
1  tsp. vanilla extract
1 (4 1/2 oz.)  can green decorator icing
1 1/4  c. pecan halves (4 oz.)
1/2  c. light brown sugar
1/3  c. dark corn syrup
3/4  c. heavy cream
  pinch of salt
1  tsp. vanilla extract
6  oz. semi-sweet chocolate

      Lightly oil a baking sheet or marble slab as well as 2 teaspoons, set aside.  Spread pecans in a single layer in a microwavable baking dish.  Cook, uncovered, on High until toasted, about 5 minutes.  In a 2-quart glass measure, stir together the sugar, corn syrup, heavy cream and salt.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and cook on High for 5 minutes.  Pierce plastic to allow steam to escape.  Uncover in oven and stir with a wooden spoon.  Cook, uncovered, on High for 4 more minutes.  Stir the toasted pecans and vanilla into the caramel.  Using the oiled spoons, drop caramel mixture a teaspoon at a time onto baking sheet.  Break chocolate into 1-ounce pieces and put into a 2 cup microwavable container.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and cook on High until just melted, about 2 1/2 minutes.  Uncover and stir. When candies are firm enough to handle and chocolate is partially cooled, dip the clusters in the chocolate and put on sheets of parchment or waxed paper.  Let stand in a cool place until chocolate has hardened.  Yield:  about 1 1/2 dozen candies.
      Serving:  Serve on the day they're made or refrigerate, in which case the chocolate may lose its gloss, but the candies will keep for a week.
