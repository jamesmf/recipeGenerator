      Boil lasagna noodles as per package directions.  Keep al-dente, meaning fully cooked, but not overly soft.  Keep noodles in cold water until ready to use.  Remove stems from spinach and dry spinach leaves. (Spinach is optional.)  Spread 1/4 cup of pasta sauce evenly over bottom of a 13x9x2 baking pan. Set aside
      Brown the ground beef, using a wooden spoon to break down the bigger chunks.  Add all the spices marked with an asterisk (*), pasta sauce and water.  Simmer for 10 minutes or until water dries up.
      Stir-fry the peppers, mushrooms and onions in a pan with some olive oil and add to the ground beef mixture.  In a bowl, combine Ricotta, Mozzarella, Parmesan, parsley, and eggs.
      Layer 3 pieces of lasagna noodles on bottom of sauce-lined baking pan.  Spoon 1/2 of ground beef mixture over the lasagna. Layer 1/2 of the spinach leaves over the ground beef (if using). Spread 1/2 of the cheese mixture onto the spinach and repeat layers; end with a layer of lasagna and remaining 1/4 cup pasta sauce.  Top with 1/2 cup shredded Mozzarella cheese.  Drizzle olive oil over cheese.
      Bake, uncovered, in pre-heated 350 degrees;F oven for 30-40 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil halfway through baking.  Remove from oven and allow to stand about 30 minutes before cutting for easier handling.
