STOVE TOP MEAT LOAF


1/2  c. bread crumbs
1/2  c. milk
1  small onion, chopped
1/4  tsp. garlic powder or to taste
1/2  tsp. oregano
1  egg
1  lb. ground round beef
  salt and pepper
1  can Hunt's spaghetti sauce
1  c. Mozzarella cheese, shredded
2  Tbsp. vegetable oil

      Soak the bread crumbs in the 1/2 cup milk.  Drain.  Mix in the onion, egg, meat and seasonings.  Shape a giant burger.  In a large nonstick pan, brown the bottom of the "burger" (3 minutes). Drain off the grease.  Turn the burger over.  Add the spaghetti sauce (you may not need all of it).  Cover and cook 15 minutes. Add the cheese.  Cover.  Cook a minute or two more, until cheese melts.
