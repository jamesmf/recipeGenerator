FRUIT ROLL UPS


  any fruit:  apples, peaches, apricots, oranges
  honey or corn syrup to taste

      Cut up and blend fruit until pureed.  Sweeten with honey or corn syrup to taste.  Line a baking tray with heavy-duty plastic wrap.  Tape to all four sides.  Spread pureed fruit evenly, leaving a one-inch border.  Bake at 150 degrees; until fruit feels leather like, pliable and no sticky spots in center.  Remove from tray while warm and roll up.  Store in refrigerator.
