PIZZA IN A POCKET



1  pkg. pita bread (10 to 12)
2  lb. Mozzarella cheese, shredded
1  onion, diced
1  medium green pepper, diced
1  pkg. pepperoni, sliced
1/2 to 1  lb. sausage, cooked
1/2  lb. mushrooms, sliced
2  cans pizza sauce

      Place all ingredients in separate bowls and have the children create their own pizzas.  Place on cookie sheet and bake at 400 degrees; until cheese is melted.  Great idea for sleepovers and birthday parties.
