VEGGIE APPETIZER PIZZA


2  tubes refrigerated crescent rolls
2  pkg. (8-oz. each) cream cheese, softened
1  c. mayonnaise
2  pkg. (1.0 oz. each) Hidden Valley Ranch Original Ranch Salad Dressing Mix
1  c. broccoli, finely chopped
1  c. cauliflower, finely chopped
2  medium tomatoes, seeded and chopped and drained on paper towels
1  can (4.5-oz.) sliced ripe olives, drained
1/2  c. grated carrots
1  c. cheddar cheese, shredded

      Preheat oven to 400 degrees;.  Press crescent rolls onto pan; form edges.  Bake for 9-10 minutes (don't let it brown).  Let cool. Mix softened cream cheese with mayonnaise and dry salad dressing mix.  Spread cream cheese mixture on cooled crust and top with vegetables and cheese.  Press down lightly and chill for at least 1 hour.  Cut into pieces.  (Don't make this too much in advance as crust becomes soggy if allowed to sit for very long.)
