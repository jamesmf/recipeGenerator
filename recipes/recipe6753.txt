SAUSAGE CASSEROLE


1  lb. sausage (mild or hot)*
1  c. chopped onion
1  c. chopped celery
1  can cream of mushroom soup
1  can cream of chicken soup
1  c. rice (not instant)

      *I use hot.
      Cook sausage and onion together.  Drain well.  I also cook my rice before adding all ingredients together and mix well.  Use a 1 1/2 or 2-quart covered Pyrex dish.  Cook at 350 degrees; approximately 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
