MARINATED CHICKEN


2  c. oil
3  c. soy sauce
1  c. Worcestershire
1 1/3  c. white vinegar
1  1/3 lemon juice
8  Tbsp. black pepper (adjust to taste)
10  lb. chicken tenders (boneless/skinless if preparing for the Simpson family!)

	Mix ingredients well except for chicken. In plastic bag, place the chicken, then pour marinade over chicken. Toss well to coat. Marinate for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours, turning to evenly marinate.
	 When ready to cook, drain marinade from chicken and discard marinade. Grill chicken on the outdoor grill or indoor Foreman grill also works great! Serve with baked beans, slaw, potato salad and rolls.
	Recipe can also be used for turkey (cut pieces accordingly). Amount of recipe can be reduced as needed.
