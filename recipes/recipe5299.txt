(Microwave Recipe)  

1  Tbsp. lemon juice
2  Tbsp. cornstarch

1  can or bag frozen blueberries (16 oz.)

      In 1-quart casserole, stir together lemon juice and cornstarch. Add sugar and salt. Stir in undrained blueberries. Microwave on High 5 to 7 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes until thickened and clear. Serve over ice cream, pancakes, unfrosted cake or cheese cake. Makes 1 1/2 cups.
