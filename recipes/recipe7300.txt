CHINESE CHICKEN


1/2  Tbsp. oil
1/2  lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut in thin slivers
1  small onion, chopped
2 1/4  c. frozen broccoli, baby carrots, water chestnut combination, partially thawed (half of 1 lb. pkg.)
3/4  c. chicken or beef broth
1 1/2  Tbsp. soy sauce
2  tsp. cornstarch

      Heat oil in nonstick skillet or wok. Add chicken and onion; stir and cook over high heat until chicken is lightly browned. Combine cornstarch with soy sauce and broth. Add to skillet along with the vegetables. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer 3 to 5 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Makes 3 servings.
      This recipe, like many stir-fry recipes, is one you can vary to use ingredients you have on hand. Beef, ham or pork may be used as well as a wide assortment of vegetables. Always include the onion; it adds a lot of flavor. One-fourth teaspoon of instant minced garlic and several tablespoons dry sherry or white wine will also add flavor.
