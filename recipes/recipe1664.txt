BAVARIAN GOULASH


1 1/2  lb. stew beef
1/4  c. vegetable oil or butter
4  onions, finely chopped
2  tomatoes, peeled and chopped
1  bay leaf
1 1/2  c. meat stock
2  Tbsp. all-purpose flour
  Burgundy or other red wine
  paprika
  salt and pepper

      Trim beef, if necessary.  Cut into bite-size pieces.  Heat the oil or butter in a heavy saucepan.  Add the beef and sauté until evenly browned on all sides.  Add the onions and sauté until nearly translucent.  Add the tomatoes and season to taste with salt, pepper and paprika.  Add the bay leaf and pour into the stock; stir well.  Cover and simmer 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until the beef is tender.  In a small bowl, combine the flour and a small amount of the wine.  Stir this into the goulash.  Cook over a low heat until the sauce is thickened.  Serve with potato dumplings or white bread dumplings, boiled or mashed potatoes.  Pasta or rice may also be served.  Yield:  4 to 6 servings.
