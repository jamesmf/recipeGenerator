CHEESE BALL


2  (8 oz.) pkgs. cream cheese
8  slices of Armour brand dried beef (it comes in a bottle and is generally found in the canned meat section)
4  green onions
1/4  c. diced black olives (optional)

      Dice the beef and green onion into small pieces. Blend into the softened cream cheese.  Add the diced black olives if desired. These will add mildness by cutting the onion flavor.  Wrap to prevent the onion aroma from taking over your refrigerator.  If possible allow the ball to set overnight for the flavors to marry. The beef has a pretty high sodium content, so it can be rinsed under water to reduce the sodium content.
