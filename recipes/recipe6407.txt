1  Tbsp. honey
2  tsp. Dijon mustard
1/8  tsp. ground ginger
12  oz. pork tenderloin
1/3  c. fat-free mayonnaise dressing or salad dressing
1/3  c. pineapple or orange juice

1  papaya, seeded, peeled, sliced lengthwise and halved
  freshly ground black pepper (optional)

      In a small bowl or custard cup, stir together the 1 tablespoon honey, 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard and 1/8 teaspoon ginger. Trim fat from pork tenderloin. Place on a rack in a shallow foil-lined roasting pan. Brush mustard mixture over outside of tenderloin. Insert a meat thermometer in center of tenderloin. Roast, uncovered, in a 425 degrees; oven for 25 to 35 minutes or until thermometer registers 160 degrees;.
       Meanwhile, for dressing, in a mixing bowl, whisk together mayonnaise dressing or salad dressing, pineapple or orange juice, the remaining 1 tablespoon honey, the 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard and 1/8 teaspoon ginger. Cover and refrigerate until serving time.
      To serve, arrange the torn greens, strawberries and papaya on 4 salad plates. Thinly slice warm tenderloin and arrange on salads. Drizzle with the dressing. If desired, sprinkle with black pepper. Makes 4 servings.
      Note: This salad rates special enough for a casual summer get-together. Substitute leftover sliced roast pork or beef if you don't have the time to roast the pork tenderloin.
