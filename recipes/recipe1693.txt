COUSCOUS SALAD


2/3  c. water
1  c. couscous
  about 3 Tbsp. olive oil
  about 3 Tbsp. lemon juice
3  scallions (including green parts), finely chopped
1/2  c. tightly packed Italian parsley, finely chopped
2  medium ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and finely chopped
3  Tbsp. finely chopped mint
  kosher salt
  black pepper

      Bring the water to a boil in a small saucepan.  Pour in the couscous.  Cover the pan and remove from the heat.  Let stand for 5 minutes.  Uncover the pan and stir the couscous right away with a fork.  (If the grains do not separate, fluff them gently with your fingers.)  Transfer the couscous to a bowl and stir in the remaining ingredients.  Season the salad to taste with more lemon juice, salt and pepper.
