DANDY CANDIES


1/3  c. honey
1/2  c. crunchy peanut butter
1/2  c. nonfat dry milk

      You will also need waxed paper.
      In a small bowl, mix honey and peanut butter.  Stir in the dry milk, a few spoonfuls at a time.  Mix until thoroughly blended. Divide the dough into four parts.  Put each on a sheet of waxed paper.  Pat and shape each part of the dough into a narrow roll or "snake".  Roll up in waxed paper.  Put into refrigerator.
      After an hour, the candy will be firm.  Unwrap and cut into 1-inch pieces.  Cut waxed paper into small squares.  Wrap each piece of candy in a square and twist ends of paper.  Makes 2 dozen dandy candies.
