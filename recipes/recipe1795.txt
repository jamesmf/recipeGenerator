ZUCCHINE RIPIENE
(Stuffed Italian Squash)  
Filling:
1/2  lb. ground beef
1  egg
3  Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese
  white part of 1/2 roll, soaked in milk, then squeezed out
  chopped parsley
1  clove garlic, minced
  salt and pepper
  grated fresh nutmeg

      Wash zucchini and scoop out flesh, leaving just enough to keep shell firm.  (This is such a popular dish in Italy that there is a special zucchini corer, much like an elongated apple corer.)  Mix ingredients for filling and stuff the hollowed zucchini.  Put some olive oil and chopped onion in low casserole or baking dish and cook over flame until onion is golden.
Sauce:
  olive oil
1  chopped onion
2 or 3  Tbsp. dry white wine
  salt and pepper
2  c. tomato sauce

      Add wine, tomato sauce, salt and pepper.  Cook 1 or 2 minutes, then add zucchini side by side.  Put in 300 degrees; oven and cook about 20 minutes.  Turn zucchini over, then continue cooking until nicely tender, about 40 minutes all together.  If you prefer, zucchini can cook over low flame instead of oven.  Let cool well before serving as flavors are lost if dish is served hot; Italians often eat their stuffed zucchini as a cold appetizer.
