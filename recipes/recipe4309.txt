PASTA SALAD


2  boxes tri-colored noodles (curly)
1/2  onion
1/2  flat of mushrooms
2  bottles "Wish-Bone Zesty Italian" dressing
2  jars pimentos, diced or chopped
2  cans artichoke hearts (Reese's)
2  cans pitted olives, sliced
1  to 2 spoons mayo or "Lite" mayo
  Parmesan cheese (lots)

      Cook the pasta noodles until almost done (you'll want them a little firm for stirring).  Then use cold water to rinse and let them sit in the refrigerator while doing rest of cutting and chopping of other ingredients.
      Take noodles out of the refrigerator and coat noodles with the 1 to 2 spoons of mayo, then add in all ingredients. Mix and stir. Add lots of Parmesan cheese as you go.
      Note: If you use this dish for the next day, add in a little more Italian dressing and Parmesan cheese to give it more zip! Enjoy!
