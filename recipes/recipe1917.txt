BEEF CHIMICHANGA



1  doz. large flour tortillas
1  lb. ground beef, cooked and drained
1  lb. grated yellow and Jack cheese, mixed
1 small  can chopped green chilies
1 medium size  can refried beans

      Add small amount of each ingredient in the middle of a flour tortilla and roll into a 2-inch diameter size (makes a burrito). Deep-fry each burrito in light oil until brown and crisp.  Drain on paper towels.  Top each serving with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, chopped green onions (optional) and more grated cheese. Garnish with pitted ripe olives (sliced), avocados (optional) and sour cream.
      Prepare for many compliments!  Also, if you like it spicy, add more green chilies to topping.
