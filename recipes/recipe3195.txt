BRUSCHETTA


1  French baguette roll
6  Roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
1/2  c. sun-dried tomatoes, packed in oil
3  cloves minced garlic
4  Tbsp. olive oil, divided
2  Tbsp. balsamic vinegar
1/4  c. fresh basil, stems removed
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. ground black pepper
2  c. shredded mozzarella cheese

      Preheat the oven on broiler setting.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the roma tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper. Allow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes.  Cut the baguette into 3/4 inch slices.  On a baking sheet, arrange the baguette slices in a single layer. Broil for 1 to 2 minutes, until slightly brown. Divide the tomato mixture evenly over the baguette slices. Top the slices with mozzarella cheese.  Broil for 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.
