CUDDY FARMS MARINATED TURKEY


2  c. 7-Up or Sprite
1  c. vegetable oil
1  c. Kikkoman soy sauce
  garlic salt

	Buy whole turkey breast; remove all skin and bones. Cut into pieces about the size of your hand. Pour marinade over turkey and refrigerate for at least 8 hours (up to 48 hours). The longer it marinates, the less cooking time it takes.
	 To cook on grill, grill on low heat for 10 minutes on one side. Turn and cook 10 more minutes. Turkey is done when meat is white all the way through.
	To stir-fry, cut turkey into finger-size pieces. Stir-fry with green peppers and onions on high heat for approximately 5 minutes.
