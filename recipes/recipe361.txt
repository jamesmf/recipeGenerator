ASPARAGUS FRITTATA


3/4  lb. fresh asparagus spears or 1 (10 oz.) pkg. frozen cut asparagus
6  eggs
3/4  c. low-fat cottage cheese
2  tsp. prepared mustard
1/8  tsp. salt
  dash of pepper
1  c. sliced fresh mushrooms
1  small tomato, cut into wedges

      Cook asparagus according to package directions, if frozen.  If fresh, cook in a small amount of boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes or until crisp-tender.  Drain spears.  Reserve 3 spears for garnish.  Cut remaining asparagus into 1-inch pieces.  Set aside. Beat eggs until foamy.  Add cottage cheese, mustard, salt and pepper; beat and set aside.  Spray a 10-inch ovenproof skillet with nonstick spray coating.  Cook mushrooms over medium heat until tender, then stir in asparagus pieces.  Pour egg mixture over mushrooms and asparagus (put 3 reserved spears on top).  Cook mixture over low heat about 5 minutes or until mixture bubbles slightly and begins to set around the edges.  Bake, uncovered, in a 400 degrees; oven about 10 minutes or until set.  Garnish each serving with tomato.  Serves 4.
