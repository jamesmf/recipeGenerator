BREAD STUFFING FOR TURKEY OR CHICKEN


4  large loaves white bread, cubed
5  or 6 stalks celery, diced in small pieces
4  large onions, diced
8  eggs
1  c. oil
  salt and pepper to taste
4  c. water

	Put oil in a large skillet; add celery, onions, salt and pepper and saut√© until tender.  Put bread cubes into a large bowl or pan and set aside.  In another bowl, break eggs and add 1 1/2 cups of water.  Stir together and pour over bread.	Next, take celery and onions and add 2 1/2 cups of water; pour over bread and eggs.  Mix all ingredients well.
	To check if you have enough salt and pepper and to see if dressing is moist enough, take a little bit of dressing and put in a small bowl. Microwave for about 1 minute. If not moist enough, add more water.
