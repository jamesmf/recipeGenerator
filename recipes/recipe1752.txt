PORK `N' CABBAGE


1  lb. pork shoulder, cut in strips
2  qt. shredded cabbage
1  c. (8 oz.) water chestnuts, drained and sliced
1  c. sliced mushrooms
2  Tbsp. chopped pimento
1  c. water
3/4  c. Kraft Italian dressing
1/4  c. soy sauce
2  Tbsp. cornstarch

      Brown meat.  Cover and cook 15 minutes; drain.  Stir in vegetables, water and Italian dressing.  Cook 8 to 10 minutes.  Add soy sauce, combined with cornstarch.  Stir until thickened.  Serve over rice, if desired.  Makes 4 to 6 servings.  Wonderfully different, with oriental twist.
