RACK OF LAMB


1  (1 3/4 to 2 lb.) rack of lamb, rib or loin section, well-trimmed
  mint sprigs (for garnish)

 
Mustard Coating:
1  c. grainy-style Dijon mustard
3  Tbsp. reduced-sodium soy sauce
4  tsp. olive oil
2  tsp. finely minced garlic
1 1/2  tsp. finely minced fresh ginger
1/2  tsp. ground rosemary
  salt and fresh ground pepper

      Preheat the oven to 425 degrees;.  Place the lamb fat side up in a roasting pan.  Combine the coating ingredients in a food processor, blender or by hand and process until smooth.  Generously paint the mixture over the lamb, covering the top and the sides.
      Roast the lamb for 30 to 35 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 135 degrees; for medium-rare.  Place the rack on a platter and allow to stand for 10 minutes.  Carve into chops and serve hot, garnished with mint sprigs.  Serves 6.
