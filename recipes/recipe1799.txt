SWISS CHOCOLATE MOUSSE


4  oz. swiss chocolate
5  eggs
5  oz. sugar
10  oz. heavy cream

      Whip heavy cream until it stands in a peak.  Refrigerate. Combine two eggs, three egg yolks and sugar in a stainless bowl and whisk till the mixture stands to a peak.  Melt chocolate over a double boiler (not warmer than body temperature).  Blend all the egg/sugar mixture with the melted chocolate a little at a time. Fold in whipped cream, reserving four spoonfuls for garnish.  Add chopped nuts or chocolate chips, if you desire.  Fill in serving dishes and refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.
