      Whisk eggs in bowl with red pepper sauce and sprinkling of salt and pepper; set aside.  In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, break ground beef into medium to small lumps.  Slowly brown beef, chopped onion, green pepper and chili powder.  Drain all grease from skillet.  Add to skillet the drained corn, tomato, olives and sprinkling of salt and pepper; add flour and mix well.  Turn heat to simmer; pour eggs mixture evenly over all.  Do not stir.  Cover skillet and cook slowly for 4 to 5 minutes or until eggs are almost set.
      When Frittata is set (all but some moisture in center), place under broiler until cheese is melted and bubbly.  Remove from oven; sprinkle with paprika and allow to sit 5 minutes before serving. Serve from skillet, cutting into pie shaped wedges.  Serves 4.
