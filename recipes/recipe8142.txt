CHICKEN AND RICE


1  chicken (broiler)
2  c. Uncle Ben's converted rice
  salt and pepper
3/4  green pepper
1/2  onion

      Boil cut up chicken until tender. Cool. (Save wings and back, all boney parts, for soup.) Take chicken off bone. (Throw away or save for another use all skin and bones.) In a clean pot, measure 5 1/3 cups of broth that chicken was cooked in. Chop green pepper and onion and add to broth. Add 2 teaspoons of salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Bring to a boil and cook 5 minutes. Add 2 cups rice. Cover and simmer for approximately 45 minutes or until rice is soft and liquid is absorbed. Turn burner off and allow to sit covered 20 minutes.
