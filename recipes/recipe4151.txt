WARM ARTICHOKE DIP


2 (14 oz.)  cans artichoke hearts, drained
1/2  c. reduced fat mayonnaise
1/2  c. nonfat sour cream
3  Tbsp. Marsala wine (optional)
1/2  tsp. curry powder or to taste
  pepper to taste
2  Tbsp. chopped scallions (white part and some green)
  paprika (optional)

      Preheat oven to 375 degrees;.  Coarsely chop artichoke hearts (they should be chunky).  In a large bowl, stir mayonnaise, sour cream, Marsala, curry powder, if desired, and pepper until evenly blended.  Stir in scallions.  Fold artichoke hearts into mixture until they are evenly coated.  Transfer mixture to a 4-cup ovenproof casserole or serving dish.
      Bake for 30 minutes or until hot and bubbly.  Sprinkle with paprika, if desired.  Serve warm with crackers, toasted pita wedges or vegetables.  Makes about 4 cups.
      (Can add precooked chicken in chunks to serve as entree with a salad and rice side dish.)
