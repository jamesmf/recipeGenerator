NEW YEAR'S CAKE
(Vasilopeta Keik)  
Cake:
4  eggs
1/2  c. butter (1 stick), softened
2 1/2  c. flour
  juice of 1/2 lemon (freshly squeezed)
1/2  tsp. baking soda
1/2  c. milk
1  c. sugar plus 1 Tbsp.
1 1/2  tsp. baking powder
  coin
  confectioners sugar for top of cake

      Separate egg yolks and egg whites.  Beat egg whites and set aside.  Beat egg yolks and set aside.  In a large bowl, cream butter and slowly add sugar; continue beating until creamy.  Slowly beat in egg yolks and flour with baking powder alternating with milk.  Lastly, add beaten egg whites and baking soda, which has been dissolved in lemon juice.
      Polish a quarter and wash it thoroughly or if you wish, use a Susan B. Anthony coin.  Wrap coin of your choice in wax paper. Place coin in batter.  Grease a 10-inch round pan and pour batter, being sure coin doesn't show.
      Bake in 350 degrees; oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out dry.  Remove from pan when cool and save cake for 12 midnight New Year's Eve.  Sift confectioners sugar on top of cooled cake.
