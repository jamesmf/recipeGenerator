EASY OVEN LASAGNA


1 1/2 to 2  lb. ground beef
8  oz. box uncooked lasagna noodles
1  large container cottage cheese (2 c. or 16 oz.)
1/4  c. grated parmesan cheese
1 medium size  jar Ragu (chunky with extra tomatoes, onions and garlic) 3 cups
2  (8 oz.) bags of mozzarella cheese
3/4  c. water

      Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Brown ground beef and drain; return to pan. Add sauce and water. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat. In 9x13 inch pan, alternate the following: meat sauce, uncooked noodles, cottage cheese, and mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers ending with sauce and parmesan cheese. The sauce will be runny. Cover with foil (very important) and bake 1 hour. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes before cutting into squares.
