PANCIT


2 to 3  Tbsp. vegetable oil
4  chicken breast
6  boneless center cut pork chops or pork tenderloin
2 to 3  cloves of garlic, smashed
1  large onion (cut in half and then into 1/4 inch strips)
4  to 5 stalks of celery sliced diagonally and thin
1  lb. fresh green beans, sliced diagonally and thin
1/2  to 3/4 head of cabbage cut into thin slices
  approximately 1/2 to 3/4 c. of soy sauce
2  pkg. pancit noodles

      Boil chicken and pork in a pot until 3/4 done.  Remove from pot and slice into 1/4 to 3/8 inch strips.  Save the water that the chicken and pork were boiled in.  Slightly brown the garlic in the vegetable oil.  Add the celery, onions, greenbeans and cabbage. Add a little broth from the water that the chicken and pork were boiled in, if the wok gets to dry.  When they are slightly cooked, add the meat.  Once that is stirred and mixed thoroughly, add the pan cit noodles.  Stir thoroughly.  Add enough soy sauce to brown the noodles slightly.  Add the broth as necessary to keep all of the ingredients moist.  When the noodles are soft, serve with rice.
Fried Rice:
3  to 4 cups of rice put into a rice cooker and put the water on the line for the amount of cups that you use
6  to 8 strips of bacon, sliced into 3/4 inch pieces and fried
1  whole onion cut in half and then into strips
2  cloves garlic, smashed
4  or 5 stalks celery, sliced diagonally and thin
4  to 6 eggs, scrambled and fried in a separate pan
  soy sauce

      After the bacon is fried, add the garlic, onions and celery. Cook until slightly tender.  Add the cooked scrambled eggs.  Add the rice and stir thoroughly.  Add enough soy sauce to make the rice slightly tan.
