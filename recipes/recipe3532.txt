HOLIDAY PRETZELS


  Round pretzel rings
  Hershey Hugs (white chocolate with stripes)
  M&M's (plain - red and green for holidays)
  Wax Paper

      Preheat oven to 200 degrees;.  Place wax paper on cookie sheet and put pretzels flat on wax paper.  Place a Hershey Hug inside each pretzel ring.  Put in oven for 5 minutes (chocolate will still look hard, but any longer will make them too soft).  Take out and immediately place one M&M candy piece on Hershey Hug.  Gently push down on M&M just until chocolate fills the entire pretzel. Chocolate Hug will flatten and harden within the pretzel ring. Let harden for a few hours and remove from wax paper.  Enjoy!!
      Note:  After a few minutes you may slide the whole wax paper on to a table so you don't run out of cookie sheets.  You may also speed up the process by letting them set in the refrigerator.  Very easy for kids to help with.  Good any time of year!
