MOLE POBLANO


2  cut-up chickens, boiled (more chicken may be used)
1 (8 oz.)  pkg. chili Pasilla
6  California chilies
1 (4 oz.)  pkg. sesame seed
1 (5 oz.)  pkg. almonds
1/2  c. dry peeled peanuts
1  tomato
1  medium onion, thinly sliced
3/4  c. oil
1  tsp. sugar
1/2  c. dry peeled pumpkin seeds
1  tsp. cinnamon
1  tsp. ground cumin seed
1/2  tsp. pepper
3  cloves garlic
3  laurel leaves
1/2  bar Ibarra chocolate
2  bananas
1  loaf French bread, cut in 8 thick slices

      Remove cooked chicken from broth and set aside, keeping chicken warm.  Reserve broth.  Slice chilies open and remove seeds.  Toast chilies in a preheated oven, just enough not to burn.  Toast bread on griddle of stove, just enough to brown.  In frying pan, fry sesame seed in 1/4 cup oil.  Remove seed and set aside.  Add 1/4 cup oil to pan and fry onion until tender.  Set aside.  Toast tomato on griddle, then peel off skin.  Be sure to follow instructions carefully to have a good tasting mole.
      Once all ingredients are prepared, you are ready to begin.  In blender, blend chilies and all other ingredients, except oil. Blend in bread and bananas last.  Put blended ingredients into a large pot with 1/4 cup oil.  Add broth, a cup at a time, stirring constantly.  Add in sugar and salt to your taste.  Continue stirring until mole is boiling, making sure mole does not stick to bottom of pan.  Mole should not be too thick or too thin.  Add in chicken right before serving.  If chicken is left in mole, it will come apart when reheated.
