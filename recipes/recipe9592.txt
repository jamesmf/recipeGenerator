SPINACH BREAD WITH SAUSAGE


1  recipe white bread dough or frozen, thawed
2  pkg. (10 oz.) frozen spinach, thawed and thoroughly drained
2  medium potatoes, boiled and diced
4  or 5 sweet Italian sausages
1  tsp. garlic powder or 2 to 3 cloves, crushed
  salt and pepper to taste

      Remove casing from sausages (or use sausage patties). Brown and crumble in frying pan.  Mix all ingredients (except for dough!) in a bowl. If mixture seems dry, add 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil.
      Roll out bread dough to a rectangle (12 x 8-inch).  Put spinach mixture on top. Fold ends and tops over and seal by pinching dough. Place seam side down on baking sheet.   Bake in 350 degrees; oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden brown. Slice and serve with a knife and fork.
       For a vegetarian meal, eliminate the sausage and add 1/2 teaspoon of fennel seed.
