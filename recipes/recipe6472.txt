EASY MEXICAN CASSEROLE


2  cans Wolf Brand chili with beans
1 medium  pkg. tortilla chips
1  lb. grated Monterey Jack cheese
1 or 2  cans green chilies (you choose, mild/hot)
1  lb. hamburger
1  onion
1  tsp. garlic salt

      Cook hamburger, onion and garlic salt until brown.  Add chili.  Mix in green chili peppers.  In a casserole dish, layer chips, meat mixture and cheese.  Repeat until all used.  Save some cheese for topping.  Top with cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees; until cheese melts.  Cooking time should be 30 minutes.  (You can put casserole in the microwave to melt cheese, if you prefer to do so.)  Serves 4.
