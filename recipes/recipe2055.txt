PENUCHE


3  c. firmly packed light brown sugar
3/4  c. milk
1  Tbsp. butter
1  Tbsp. light corn syrup
1/4  tsp. salt
1  tsp. vanilla
1  c. coarsely chopped walnuts or pecans

      In heavy medium saucepan over low heat, stir together the sugar, milk, butter, corn syrup and salt until sugar dissolves. Over medium heat, bring to a boil; continue boiling, stirring occasionally, until mixture reaches 238 degrees; on a candy thermometer or a little dropped in very cold water forms a soft ball that flattens on removal from water.  Remove from heat; cool to lukewarm (110 degrees;). Add vanilla.  Beat until mixture holds its shape when dropped from a spoon and loses its gloss.  This takes considerable beating. Quickly stir in nuts.  Pour at once into a buttered 8 x 8 x 2-inch pan.  Cut when cold.
