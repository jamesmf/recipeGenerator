MUSHROOM TOFU QUICHE


12  oz. tofu (fresh bean curd), drained and cut up
2  egg whites
1  egg
1/3  c. skim milk
1/2  tsp. dried oregano, crushed
1/8  tsp. garlic powder
3/4  c. shredded low-fat Cheddar cheese
1/4  tsp. pepper
1/8  tsp. salt
1 (7 oz.)  can whole kernel corn with sweet peppers, drained
1  Tbsp. dried minced onion
1  tsp. margarine
2  Tbsp. fine dry bread crumbs
1  medium tomato, cut in thin wedges
1  Tbsp. snipped fresh parsley (optional)

      Combine tofu, egg whites, whole egg, milk, oregano, garlic powder, 1/2 cup cheese, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and 1/8 teaspoon salt in blender.  Cover and blend or process until smooth.  Stir in corn and dried onion.  Prepare a 9-inch pie plate by spreading margarine over the bottom and sides and sprinkling with bread crumbs.  Pour tofu mixture into pie plate.  Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees; for 30 to 35 minutes (a knife inserted near the center should come out clean). Arrange tomato wedges on top of quiche and sprinkle with remaining cheese.  Bake until cheese is melted (about 3 minutes).  Garnish with parsley.  Makes 4 servings.
