  candy sprinkles
  graham crackers, crushed
1  bag chocolate morsels (6 oz.)
1  bag large marshmallows
  bamboo skewer
2  tsp. vegetable oil

      Pour sprinkles into a bowl.  Crush some graham crackers into another bowl.  These are what you will use to decorate your candy. Combine one 6 ounce bag of chocolate morsels with 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave on High 1 minute, until melted; stir.  Poke a bamboo skewer or a fork into a marshmallow.  Dip into chocolate, coating it well.  Hold it over bowl to let excess chocolate drip off.  Coat marshmallow with sprinkles or graham cracker crumbs.  Slide marshmallow off skewer onto a waxed paper-lined baking sheet.  Repeat.  Let set at room temperature about 1 hour.
