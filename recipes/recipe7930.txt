CHICKEN QUESADILLAS


1  pkg. flour tortillas (small-sized)
2  large, skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1  tsp. salt
1-1/2  tsp. garlic powder
1-1/2  tsp. onion powder
1-1/2  tsp. cajun seasoning
1  tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
3  Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided
1  large onion, thickly sliced
1  each, green, yellow and red peppers, cut into strips
1 (12 oz.)  pkg. shredded, Mexican style 4 cheese blend

      Washed and pat dry the chicken breasts.  Marinate with garlic powder, onion powder, cajun seasoning, and crushed red pepper flakes.   Add a bit of water and boil until chicken is tender. Let cool then cut into thin strips.  Set aside.
      In a large sauté pan, heat 1-1/2 Tbsp. of the oil and stir-fry the green, red, and yellow peppers until tender-crisp.  Now add the onion slices and stir-fry just until opaque.  Combine the chicken with the pepper and onion mixture and stir-fry another minute.  Transfer stir-fried items to a bowl and wipe inside of sauté pan with a napkin or paper towel.
      Using the remaining oil, smear a few drops on the sauté pan. Heat pan and toss in a tortilla.  Use a spatula to turn tortilla and cook the other side until slightly browned and crisp. (Tortillas may puff up while heating.)  Spoon 3-4 Tbsp. of the chicken mixture into center of tortilla.  Measure 1/8 cup of cheese and sprinkle on top of chicken mixture.  Now fold tortilla over in half and press down with spatula.  The cheese will melt, keeping the tortilla shaped in half.  Flip the halved tortilla once and remove when both sides are evenly browned.
      Repeat procedure until all tortillas are filled.  Serve quesadillas hot with sour cream, salsa, and bottled jalapeno peppers.
