MARINATED HALIBUT TACOS


2  Tbsp. butter, melted
2  Tbsp. prepared red jalapeno jelly, plus more to serve
2  Tbsp. minced onion
  salt, to taste
  ground black pepper, to taste
1  lb. halibut fillets
6  corn tortillas
1  tomato, finely diced
2  c. iceberg lettuce, finely shredded
1  c. sour cream

      To make marinade, in a small bowl, combine butter, jelly, onion, salt and pepper.  Mix well.  Place fish in a 9 X 9 inch baking dish.  Brush both sides with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, prepare and preheat an outdoor grill or broiler.  Remove fish from marinade and grill over hot coals or under broiler 5 minutes on each side or until fish is tender and flakes with a fork.  Slice into 1/2 inch wide pieces. Place several pieces on one side of each tortilla.  Top each with tomato, lettuce and a dollop of sour cream.  Fold tortillas. Serve with a small dish of jelly on the side.  Makes 6 servings.
