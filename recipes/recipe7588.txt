MARGARET'S MACARONI & CHEESE


1/2  lb. elbow macaroni (about 2 cups uncooked)
1/4  c. (4 Tbsp.) softened butter, divided
1  lb. of sliced and diced American cheese, divided
3  eggs
1 (12 oz.)  can evaporated milk, divided
  Pinch of salt
  Pinch of pepper

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Cook macaroni according to package directions until almost done.  (Completely done macaroni makes a mushy casserole.)  Drain macaroni and rinse with cold water. Grease a deep, 8-inch round baking dish with 1/3 of the softened butter.  (I use a 1-1/2 qt round casserole dish.)  Pour half of macaroni into dish.  Spread 2/3 of the cheese over macaroni.  Dot with 1/3 of the butter.  Repeat with remaining macaroni and cheese. Lightly beat eggs with fork while slowly pouring half a can of evaporated milk into mixture.  Pour egg and milk mixture over macaroni in baking dish.  Pour remaining evaporated milk over mixture until milk is level with macaroni.  Dot remaining butter over top.  Bake for 1 1/2 hours at 350 degrees; or until sides pull away from pan.  Mixture should not be wet in the center.  Take out and cool for 10 minutes before serving.  Makes 6 servings.
