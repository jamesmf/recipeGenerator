POTATO CHEESE SOUP


2  c. diced raw potatoes
3  Tbsp. chopped onion
3  c. water
2  c. milk
3  Tbsp. margarine
1/4  c. flour
1  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. black pepper
1  c. grated cheese
1  Tbsp. parsley

      Cook potatoes and onion in water until tender; do not drain. Melt margarine in another saucepan; stir in flour, salt, black pepper, cheese and milk and cook until smooth and thickened.  Add cheese sauce to potatoes and onion; stir to mix.   Sprinkle with parsley.  (If soup is too thin, add a few instant potatoes to thicken.)  Do not boil.
