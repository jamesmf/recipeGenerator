HANK'S POTATO SALAD


2 1/2  lb. Idaho potatoes, peeled
1  medium yellow onion, finely chopped
1/2  c. olive or canola oil
1/2  c. white wine vinegar
2  tsp. salt or to taste
1 1/2  tsp. sugar
1/4  tsp. pepper
1 1/2  tsp. dry yellow mustard
1/4  c. fresh parsley or 1 Tbsp. dry parsley

      Cook peeled, quartered potatoes in lightly salted boiling water for 20 to 25 minutes until tender.
      Meanwhile, make dressing by combining all remaining ingredients in a large bowl. When potatoes are cooked and cool enough to handle, but still warm, cut into cubes and gently fold into dressing.  Serves 6 to 8.
