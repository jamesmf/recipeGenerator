1/2  bunch broccoli
2  c. firmly packed spinach leaves (about 4 oz.)
  margarine or butter
1/2  tsp. dried oregano leaves
  salt
1  (15 oz.) part-skim Ricotta cheese
2  large eggs
12  lasagna noodles
1/4  c. flour
2 1/2  c. milk
1/4  c. grated Parmesan cheese
1  (8 oz.) part-skim Mozzarella cheese, sliced

      About 2 hours before serving, dice zucchini.  Coarsely chop broccoli and spinach.  Cook zucchini, broccoli, oregano and 1/4 teaspoon salt over medium heat in 2 tablespoons hot margarine or butter, stirring frequently, until vegetables are tender-crisp (about 5 minutes).  Add spinach and toss until wilted.  Remove skillet from heat.  In medium bowl with fork, mix Ricotta and eggs; set aside.  Prepare lasagna noodles as label directs.  Drain.
