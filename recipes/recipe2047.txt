AFTER DINNER MINTS


1  egg white
1  box powdered sugar
1  Tbsp. water
4  Tbsp. butter, softened

      Beat egg white with water until fluffy.  Mix in powdered sugar and butter and make a round ball.  Divide into three parts and add mint flavoring or color of your choice.  Pinch off small amount about the size of a dime.  Roll into a ball; lay on waxed paper. When they dry a little, mash with a table fork to make an indentation.  Let dry overnight.  This will make about 100 mints.
