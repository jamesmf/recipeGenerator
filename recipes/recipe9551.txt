BAKED SALMON


4  salmon fillets (8 oz. each)
4  cloves fresh garlic, sliced thin
1  bunch cilantro
  white wine
  lemon
  red pepper flakes (optional)

      Place each fillet on individual piece of aluminum foil large enough to completely wrap and lightly seal salmon.  Put garlic slices on top of salmon, salt and pepper to taste and a few sprigs of fresh cilantro.  Add a splash of white wine.  Wrap and seal salmon in foil.
       Bake at 475 degrees; for 15 minutes.  Unwrap. Remove cilantro. Garnish with a thin slice of lemon.  Serve over bed of white rice. For a little spice, you may add crushed red pepper flakes on top of each fillet.  Serves 4.
