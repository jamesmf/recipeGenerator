TURKEY AND BLACK BEAN CHILI


1  Tbsp. olive oil
1  c. diced (1/4-inch) red bell pepper
1/2  c. diced (1/4-inch) carrot
1  Tbsp. chili powder or more to taste
2 (16 oz.)  cans black beans, drained and rinsed or 3 3/4 c. cooked black beans (1 1/2 c. dried)
1  Tbsp. tomato paste
  salt and freshly ground black pepper
1  c. chopped onion
1  clove garlic, finely chopped
2  tsp. ground cumin
1  lb. ground turkey
3  c. reduced-sodium canned chicken broth, fat skimmed
  chopped cilantro, diced tomato, chopped fresh green chili peppers or low-fat yogurt (for toppings)

      Heat the oil in a large wide saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the onions, peppers, carrot and garlic and cook, stirring until the vegetables are very tender and the onions are golden, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle with the chili powder and cumin and stir to blend, letting the spices toast for a minute or so. Add the turkey and cook, stirring and breaking up the meat until the turkey loses its pink color, about 5 minutes. Add the beans, broth and tomato paste. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally until the liquid has reduced and the chili has thickened, about 1 hour. Correct the seasonings and serve with bowls of toppings. Makes 8 servings.
