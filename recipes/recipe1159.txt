ORANGE SPICED CARROTS


1  lb. young tender carrots, without tops
1/2  c. water
1/2  c. orange juice
1  Tbsp. margarine
1/2  tsp. pure vanilla
1/4  tsp. ground nutmeg
1 1/2  tsp. grated, fresh orange rind

      Wash carrots and pare them with a vegetable peeler.  Remove ends.  Cut carrots crosswise into 1/4-inch rounds.  In a saucepan, put water, orange juice and margarine.  Add carrots.  Cover tightly and simmer over low heat 25 minutes or until carrots are crisp and tender.  Check to make sure that carrots do not burn, because most of the liquid will be absorbed.  Add a few tablespoons of water if necessary.  Sprinkle carrots with vanilla and orange rind; mix well.
