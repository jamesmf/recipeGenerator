TOAD IN THE HOLE


1  pat margarine
1  slice whole wheat bread
1  egg
1  slice cheese

      On medium heat melt the margarine in the skillet.  Cut a hole in center of the bread.  Lay bread in the skillet and crack the egg so the yolk lands in the hole.  Let cook for 1 or 2 minutes.  Turn and cook 1 1/2 minutes until it is all cooked.  Top with a slice of cheese.  Serve on a plate with salt and pepper.
