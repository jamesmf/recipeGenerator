COOKING A COUNTRY HAM


1  country ham
1/2  box brown sugar

      First, wash that mold off with warm water (for you "city slickers," ham mold does not mean it's no good).  Now, cut off the hock end (that's the smallest end) with meat saw.  Put ham in cooker (or lard stand) and let soak overnight.  You don't have to do this if you're cooking a "store bought" ham.  Pour off water and put fresh water over ham with brown sugar.  Let ham come to boil and boil for 1 hour.
      Remove cooker from stove and cover with newspapers and old quilts or coverlet.  Let stand for 24 hours.  Remove wrappings; take ham out of water.  Keep refrigerated.
