FRUIT TART


1/3  c. whole wheat flour
1/3  c. all-purpose flour
1  Tbsp. sugar
3  Tbsp. margarine
2  Tbsp. ice water
2  tsp. sugar
1  tsp. cornstarch
1/2  c. orange juice
1  kiwi fruit, peeled and sliced
3/4  c. banana, thinly sliced
1  c. strawberries, thinly sliced

      Crust:  Combine flours and 1 tablespoon sugar; cut in margarine until dough resembles coarse crumbs.  Sprinkle with ice water and toss until crumbly; form into a ball.  Put ball of dough between two pieces of wax paper and roll into a 10-inch circle.  Remove top sheet of wax paper and invert onto an ungreased baking sheet. Remove remaining wax paper and crimp pastry edges.  Prick all over with a fork.  Bake at 400 degrees; for 12 to 15 minutes (should be lightly browned).  Cool.
      Glaze:  Combine 2 teaspoons sugar and cornstarch; stir in orange juice and cook until thick and bubbly.  Remove from heat and cool.
      Assembly:  Place crust on serving plate.  Arrange fruit with kiwi in center, then banana and strawberries around the outside. Spoon glaze over the top.  Chill for 1 hour.  Makes 6 Servings.
