ALMOND BUTTER CRUNCH CANDY


1 1/2  c. almonds
1  c. butter or margarine
1 1/2  c. sugar
3  Tbsp. corn syrup
3  Tbsp. water
4  oz. sweet chocolate

      Place almonds on a cookie sheet; toast in moderate 375 degrees; oven for 10 minutes or until lightly golden.  Combine butter, sugar, corn syrup and water in a medium-sized heavy saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, to 300 degrees; on candy thermometer.  A teaspoon of syrup will separate into brittle threads when dropped into cold water.  Remove from heat.  Stir in 1 cup toasted almonds. Pour into a buttered 13 x 9 x 2-inch pan, spreading quickly and evenly.  Cool.  Turn out onto wax paper.
      Melt chocolate in top of a double boiler over hot water. Remove from heat.  Pour over and spread over the top of candy. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup nuts over chocolate.  Stick in refrigerator or freezer until chocolate hardens.  Break into pieces with hands.
