1  roasting chicken, about 4 lb.
1 12  oz. pkg. herbed bread stuffing
1  c. water
3  Tbsp. butter

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place roasting rack in large roasting pan.  Rinse chicken; pat dry with paper towels.  In large bowl, toss stuffing with 1 cup water. In large skillet, melt butter over medium heat.  Add onion, spinach, prosciutto, garlic, sage and rosemary to skillet; saut√© until tender, about 5 minutes. Add spinach mixture to stuffing.  Stir in heavy cream and lemon juice; mix well.  Spoon stuffing loosely into chicken cavity, filling about 3/4 full.  Fold skin over openings and close with metal skewers.  Tuck wings under chicken.
