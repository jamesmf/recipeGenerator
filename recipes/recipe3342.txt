PARMESAN CHEESE CRISPS


1 1/2  c. shredded Parmesan cheese
1  Tbsp. olive oil (optional)
2  Tbsp. flour (optional)

      Cover nonstick baking sheet with Silpat liner or parchment paper rubbed with olive oil, then sprinkles with flour.  Put a tablespoon of shredded cheese on the liner and flatten it slightly.  Repeat with remaining cheese, arranging the tiny piles as if they were cookies on the sheet; allow 1/2-inch between piles.  Bake 10 minutes in a 350 degrees; oven or until cheese is bubbling and slightly browned.  Cool for 5 minutes, then lift the crisps from the sheets with a spatula and serve at once.  Can be kept for several days in an airtight container.
      Note:  You can also roll them into a cone while still warm or crack them when cooled and sprinkle over salad for a different presentation.
