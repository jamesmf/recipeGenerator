HAMBURGER PIE


1  lb. ground beef
1/2  c. chopped onion
1 (16 oz.)  can cut green beans, drained
1 (10 3/4 oz.)  can condensed tomato soup
3  medium potatoes, peeled and quartered (1 lb.)
1  beaten egg
  milk
1/2  c. shredded American cheese (2 oz.)

      In a large skillet, cook ground beef and onion until meat is browned and onion is tender; drain off fat. Stir in beans, soup, 1/4 cup water, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Turn mixture into a 1 1/2-quart casserole.
      In a covered pan, cook potatoes in boiling salted water about 20 minutes or just until tender; drain. Mash while hot; stir in egg. Add enough milk to make potatoes fluffy, yet stiff enough to hold their shape. Season with salt and pepper. Drop potatoes in mounds atop meat mixture. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, in a 350 degrees; oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until heated through. Makes 4 to 6 servings.
