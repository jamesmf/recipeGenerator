SHRIMP BOULETTES OR PATTIES


1  qt. shrimp (raw; about 3 c.) or crabmeat or crawfish
1  onion
3  to 4 green onions
1/2  tsp. parsley flakes
1/2  bell pepper (optional)
1  tsp. minced garlic
2  raw eggs
1 to 1 1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper
  Tony's
1  medium to 2 small potatoes

	In food processor, place onions, bell pepper and green onions. Do these first and then process potatoes and shrimp. Add eggs when all is processed and mix well. Now add your seasoning to the mixture and drop by teaspoon in hot oil and cook until brown.
	 If you want shrimp patties, do the same thing, except make like hamburgers, roll in fish fry and fry in less oil.
