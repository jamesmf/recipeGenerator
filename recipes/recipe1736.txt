LENTIL AND FRANKFURTER SOUP


1  Tbsp. salad oil
1 (16 oz.)  pkg. frankfurters, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1  medium size red or green pepper, diced
1  large carrot, diced
1  large onion, diced
1  garlic clove, minced
2  medium size celery stalks, diced
1 (16 oz.)  pkg. dry lentils
1/4  tsp. pepper
2  chicken flavor bouillon cubes or envelopes

      About 2 hours before serving, in 5-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat in hot salad oil, cook frankfurters until lightly browned on all sides, stirring frequently.  With slotted spoon, remove frankfurters to bowl; cover and refrigerate.  In drippings remaining in Dutch oven over medium heat, cook celery, red pepper, carrot, onion and garlic until tender, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Meanwhile, rinse lentils in running cold water and discard any stones or shriveled lentils.  Add lentils, pepper, bouillon, 11 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt to vegetable mixture in Dutch oven.  Over high heat, heat to boiling.  Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 1 hour or until lentils are very tender and soup has thickened.  Return frankfurters to Dutch oven and cook until done.
