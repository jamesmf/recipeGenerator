ARIZONA WAGONWHEEL


1  pound hot dogs, coined
1  medium onion, chopped
1  can kidney beans or chili beans

1/2  cup velveeta cheese
1/8  tsp. red pepper
1/2  tsp. garlic salt

  chili powder to taste (I use 1 Tbsp.)

      Melt 2 Tbsp. butter in large pan.  Add hotdogs and fry till slightly browned.  Add onion and saut until soft.  Add catsup (I add about 1/2 cup water to make it more moist).  Add spices and simmer about 20 - 30 minutes.  Add cheese and stir until melted.
