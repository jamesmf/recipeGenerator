CHICKEN WITH RICE


3  Tbsp. olive oil
1  tsp. sweet paprika or a sprinkle of 2 Tbsp. sofrito
1/4  c. tomato sauce
1  lb. chicken breast, cut into bite-size pieces
2  c. uncooked long grain rice
  ground annatto
1/2  tsp. salt
3 1/2  c. water

	Heat olive oil and saut√© the paprika or sofrito.  If using ground annatto, add when you add the water.  Add tomato sauce. Cook until the mixture comes to a boil, about 1 minute.  Add the chicken and cook until it turns white, then add the rice.  Mix well with the other ingredients.  If you are using ground annatto, dissolve the annatto and salt in the water.  Pour the water mixture into the pan with the rice.  Cook on medium low, until the liquid has evaporated.  Cover and cook until the rice is tender, 15 -20 minutes.
