CHAR-GRILLED SALMON STEAKS



4  salmon steaks (3/4-inch thick) or your favorite fish steaks

 
Grilling Sauce:
3 to 4  cloves garlic, minced
4  Tbsp. reduced-sodium soy sauce
2  Tbsp. yellow mustard
4  Tbsp. butter or margarine
1/4  c. ketchup
1/4  tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1  sliced lemon (for garnish)
3  to 4 sprigs parsley (for garnish)

      Combine all sauce ingredients in a small saucepan; heat for 5 minutes on medium heat. Stir well and set aside. Preheat grill. Place salmon on foil on the grill; baste several times with sauce and grill until done. Fish will flake easily when fully cooked. Can use a fairly hot fire.
