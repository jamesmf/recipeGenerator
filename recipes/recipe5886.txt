CALICO COLE SLAW


1  head cabbage, chopped
1  onion, chopped
1  bell pepper, chopped
1 large  jar pimento, chopped
1  c. vinegar
3/4  c. salad oil (Crisco or Wesson oil)
1  c. sugar
2  tsp. salt
1  Tbsp. celery seed

      Mix the first 4 ingredients in a large bowl. Next, mix in a saucepan the remaining ingredients and heat. Bring to a boil and pour over the veggies.
       Better if made the night before. Will keep for a couple of weeks in the icebox.
