SPARKLING FRUIT PUNCH


1  qt. cranberry cocktail, chilled
1 (12 oz.)  can frozen pink lemonade
1  qt. pineapple juice
1/4  c. grenadine syrup or maraschino cherry syrup
1  qt. ginger ale or carbonated lemon-lime beverage, chilled
  ice ring

      In a large punch bowl or container, mix all fruit juices and syrup together.  Chill until ready to serve.  Add ginger ale and mix.  Serve in a punch bowl or in glasses over ice.  Serves 25, 1/2 cup each or 12 large servings.
      Ice Ring:  In a 6 or 6 1/2-cup ring mold, arrange whole or halved maraschino cherries or strawberries and orange slices in an attractive design.  Pour water or weak lemonade over fruit just to cover.  Freeze.  When frozen, add water or lemonade to fill 3/4 full.  Freeze again.  At serving time, place mold in hot water a few seconds to loosen and unmold.  Float fruit side up.  If you prefer, freeze ring without decoration.  Some of the punch can also be used in place of water.
