BAKED LASAGNE


12  oz. lasagne noodles
1/2  c. Parmesan cheese
3/4 to 1  lb. Ricotta cheese
3/4 to 1  lb. Mozzarella cheese

 
Sauce:
2  Tbsp. olive or salad oil
1 1/2  lb. ground chuck
1/2  c. minced onion
1  clove garlic, chopped
18  oz. tomato paste
3  c. water
2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
3  bay leaves or basil
1/2  tsp. oregano
2  Tbsp. parsley

      Brown meat in heated oil. Add tomato paste diluted with water, onion, garlic, parsley, salt, pepper, bay leaves or basil and oregano. Cover and simmer 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove bay leaves. Reserve about 1 1/2 cups sauce to serve with lasagne at table.
      In large roasting pan or large casserole dish, alternate layers of sauce, noodles and cheese, beginning with sauce and ending with cheeses. Bake for 30 minutes or so in a 350 degrees; oven. Serves 8 to 10 people.
      This is excellent with just a tossed salad and garlic bread.
