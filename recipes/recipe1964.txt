REFRIED BEANS


2  lb. bag pinto beans
1  large onion, chopped
2  Tbsp. garlic powder
2  Tbsp. cumin
2  Tbsp. oregano
2  to 3 dashes of hot sauce or Tabasco
  water (to fill pot)
  spice to your taste (feel free to add more or less spice)

      Wash and soak beans in water overnight.  When ready to cook, put beans, onion, spices and water in large pot; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until a thick batter consistency (about 4 to 5 hours).  Store in desired size of bowls and freeze.
      When ready to cook, thaw overnight; put beans, shredded sharp Cheddar cheese and a splash of water in frypan.  Cook on medium heat until hot.  Put in serving bowl; sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Serve with corn chips (salsa, if desired).
