STUFFED MUSHROOMS


1 1/2  lb. large fresh mushrooms (about 20; remove stems and save)
1/4  c. chopped onion
2  cloves garlic, minced
1  Tbsp. margarine
1 (10 oz.)  pkg. frozen chopped spinach (thaw, drain and squeeze out excess liquid)
1/4  c. grated Parmesan cheese
1/4  c. fine bread crumbs
1/4  c. finely chopped pimiento
1/2  tsp. dried basil, crushed
1/2  tsp. dried oregano, crushed
1/4  tsp. salt
  dash of pepper

      Spray  a  15  x  10  x  1-inch baking pan with nonstick coating.  Chop  enough  mushroom  stems  to make 2 cups.  Cook chopped  mushroom  stems,  onion and garlic in margarine until onion is tender, but not browned (use a 10-inch skillet).  Add spinach  and  cook  over low heat until most of the liquid has evaporated.  Stir  in  cheese,  bread crumbs, pimiento, basil, oregano,  salt  and pepper.  Spoon mixture into mushroom tops. Place  stuffed  mushroom  tops  in the prepared baking pan and bake  at  425 degrees;  for  10  to  15 minutes or until mushrooms are tender.  Makes about 20 servings.
