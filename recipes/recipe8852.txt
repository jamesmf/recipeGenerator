ULTIMATE MACARONI


8  oz. small macaroni
1  c. sour cream
3/4  tsp. black pepper
2 1/2  c. sharp Cheddar cheese
2  c. large curd cottage cheese
1  egg, lightly beaten
2  tsp. Dijon mustard

      Cook macaroni according to package instructions.
       Meanwhile, in large bowl, combine the remaining ingredients, except 1/2 cup of the cheese. Drain macaroni thoroughly and toss with cheese mixture in bowl. Turn evenly into buttered 8 x 8 x 2-inch baking dish (lightly greased). Top with remaining cheese and bake, uncovered, in preheated 375 degrees; oven 30 to 35 minutes or until set. If top browns too quickly, cover with foil after 20 minutes of baking.
