BUDGET BOUILLABAISSE


1 (28 oz.)  can whole tomatoes
2  c. water
1  c. chopped onion
1/2  c. chopped celery
2  cloves garlic, finely sliced
2  tsp. or 2 cubes chicken bouillon
1  tsp. parsley flakes
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. thyme
1/4  tsp. oregano
  dash of ground red or cayenne pepper
1  bay leaf
1  tsp. lemon juice
2  Tbsp. cornstarch
1/2  c. cold water
1  lb. frozen cod or other whitefish, partially thawed and cut into 1-inch pieces

      Heat tomatoes (with liquid) and the remaining ingredients except cornstarch, 1/2 cup water and the fish to boiling. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, 15 minutes. Remove bay leaf.
       Mix cornstarch and water; stir into broth. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils. Stir in fish. Simmer until fish is tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper if desired.
      Note: Goes good with saltines.
