SAVORY ITALIAN BEEF


1  (3 to 4 lb.) beef roast
2 (1 oz.)  pkg. Italian dressing mix
1 (12 oz.)  can beer or beef broth
1  pkg. dried onion soup mix
1  Tbsp. cornstarch (optional)
2  Tbsp. water (optional)

      Brown roast in hot skillet.  Place roast in crock-pot. Sprinkle dressing and soup mixes over meat.  Pour beer or broth over meat.  Cover and cook on low 8 to 10 hours.  Remove meat from cooker and shred.  If thicker gravy is desired, stir cornstarch into water until all lumps are gone.  Return shredded meat to pot. Cover and cook on high another 15 to 30 minutes.
      Note: Sometimes I marinate the roast overnight in Italian dressing as well. Serve on sandwich buns with mild or hot pepperoncini.
