MARGARITA SHRIMP


5  Tbsp. oil (not olive)
1  lb. raw medium shrimp, peeled and halved lengthwise
1/2  c. minced green onions
2  large garlic cloves, crushed
1/4  c. tequila
2  Tbsp. fresh lime juice
1/2  tsp. salt
5  to 6 lime wedges

      Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp, onions and garlic and saut until shrimp just begin to turn pink (about 1 minute). Remove from heat and add tequila. Return to heat and bring to a boil, scraping up any brown bits. Transfer to a medium bowl to cool. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.) Cover and refrigerate.
      Just before serving, toss shrimp mixture with lime juice and salt. Garnish with lime wedges.
