EASY OVEN FRIED CHICKEN


1/4  cup Fat (half butter and half Crisco)
1  1/2 to 3 lb frying chicken (cut up or 4 good sized chicken breasts)
1  cup bisquick
1  tsp salt
1/4  tsp pepper
1/4  tsp paprika

      Heat oven to 400 degrees.  Melt fat in a shallow roasting pan in the oven.  Meanwhile, wash the chicken and dry with paper towels.  Place the flour and seasonings in a plastic bag.  Drop in 2 or 3 pieces of chicken at a time,  hold the bag closed and shake, coating the pieces.  Place the floured chicken in the baking pan in a single layer, skin side down.  Bake for 30 minutes,  turn the chicken skin side up and continue to bake for 30 minutes or until tender.
