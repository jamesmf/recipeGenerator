CROSTINI


1/4  loaf whole wheat baguette (4 oz.)
4  plum tomatoes
1  c. (4 oz.) shredded part-skim Mozzarella
3  Tbsp. prepared pesto sauce

      Preheat oven to 400 degrees;. Slice baguette into 16 very thin diagonal slices. For ease in slicing, freeze loaf for about 30 minutes. Slice each tomato vertically into 4 (1/4-inch) slices.
      Place baguette slices on nonstick baking sheet. Top each with 1 tablespoon cheese, then 1 slice tomato. Bake for about 8 minutes or until bread is lightly toasted and cheese is melted. Remove from oven; top each crostini with about 1/2 teaspoon pesto sauce. Garnish with fresh basil, if desired. Serve warm. Makes 8 (2 per person).
