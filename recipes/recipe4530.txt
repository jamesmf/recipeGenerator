HOMEMADE VEGETABLE SOUP


1  chuck roast, cut up
1  onion, chopped
1/2  bell pepper, chopped
2  to 3 onion tops, chopped
1/2  tsp. parsley flakes
1/2  tsp. garlic, minced
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper
2  potatoes, diced
2  cans tomato sauce
1  can Ro-Tel
1/2  can whole tomatoes, cut up
2  cans whole kernel corn
2  cans sweet peas
1  can cut green beans
1  can lima beans

	In a large pot, add meat and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer partially covered for about 1 hour or until meat is tender. Skim off any fat and scum that may form from boiling. Next, add all other ingredients, except potatoes and cook for about 1 to 2 hours. Season to taste. Add your potatoes; you can also add spaghetti (about 1/4 of the bag), broken in 3, at the same time as the potatoes.
