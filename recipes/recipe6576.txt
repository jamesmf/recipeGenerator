WENDY'S EASY POT PIE


2  deep-dish pie crusts
1  pkg. boneless chicken breast

1  can cream of celery soup
1  can Veg-All, drained

      Cook chicken. Cool and chop. Mix chicken with cream of celery and cream of chicken soups and the Veg-All. Put mixture into pie crust. (I use Pillsbury pie crust that comes 2 to a box in the dairy section.) Put other pie crust on top. Pinch crust together. Bake 45 minutes to 1 hour at 350 degrees;.
