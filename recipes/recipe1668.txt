1/2  c. sugar
3  eggs
1/2  c. finely chopped almonds
1 (6 oz.)  pkg. semi-sweet chocolate pieces, finely chopped
1  tsp. vanilla

      Cream together margarine and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in almonds, 3/4 cup chopped chocolate and vanilla.  Sift together flour, baking powder and salt.  Stir into butter mixture.  Divide evenly between 3 greased and waxed paper-lined and regreased 8-inch layer cake pans.  Bake about 20 minutes in a moderately hot 375 degrees; oven or until edges start to pull away from sides.  Cool on rack 10 minutes.  Turn out; remove waxed paper.  Cool cake layers on rack. Whip the cream with honey until stiff.  Place one cake layer on serving plate; sprinkle with 1/3 of liqueur.  Spread with 1/3 of whipping cream.  Cover evenly with 1/2 sour cherries.  Place 2nd layer on top; press down slightly.  Repeat as for first layer.  Top with 3rd layer; press down slightly.  Sprinkle with liqueur.  Cover with whipped cream.  Decorate top and sides with reserved 1/4 cup chocolate and maraschino cherries.  Chill well before serving. Makes one 8-inch layer cake.
