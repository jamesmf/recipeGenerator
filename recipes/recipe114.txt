BEST-EVER BASIC CHOCOLATE CHUNK COOKIES


8  Tbsp. (1 stick) unsalted butter (room temperature)
1/4  c. sugar
1/2  c. packed light brown sugar
1  tsp. vanilla
1/2  tsp. salt
1  egg
1/2  tsp. baking soda
1  c. flour
3/4  c. (3 oz.) coarsely chopped walnuts
2  c. (12 oz.) coarsely chopped semi-sweet chocolate chunks

      In a large mixing bowl, combine butter, sugars, vanilla and salt; beat with a spoon until fluffy.  Beat in egg and baking soda. Stir in flour, walnuts and chocolate chunks.  Transfer to a bowl just large enough to hold the dough; cover and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours or overnight.
      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Lightly coat 1 or 2 baking sheets with vegetable shortening.  Using 2 to 3 tablespoons of dough for each cookie, shape the dough into balls and place one in the center of the cookie sheet.  Evenly space four others a few inches in from each corner.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the cookies spring back when touched very lightly.  Cool on sheets for 2 minutes, transfer to paper towels to cool for about 2 minutes more, then transfer to racks to cool completely.  Repeat the baking procedure with cool baking sheets, coating them with additional shortening for each batch.
