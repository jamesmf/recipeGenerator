CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS


3 - 4  lb. baking hen
2  or 3 pieces celery
2  or 3 pieces onion
  salt to taste
  pepper to taste

	Take one cup of broth and set aside to cool.  Put the rest of the broth back in pot.
Dumplings:
2 1/2  c. all purpose flour
1  large egg, yolk only (2 if small)
1  c. broth

	Mix all together and knead thoroughly. (You may have to add some liquid.)  Roll dough out thinly, on a board.	Use a very sharp knife to cut into small blocks.  Drop blocks into boiling broth.  Cook from 4 to 5 minutes.  Add chicken back to dumplings for about 2 minutes and serve hot.
