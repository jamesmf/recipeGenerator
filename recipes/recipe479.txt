KICK THE CAN ICE CREAM


1  c. whole or low-fat milk
1  c. whipping cream
1/2  tsp. vanilla
1/2  c. white sugar (brown sugar for caramel flavor)
  nuts or fruit (if desired)

      You will also need rock salt and both 1 and 3 pound coffee cans.
      Put all ingredients in 1 pound can with tight fitting lid (no need to stir).  Put 1 pound can inside 3 pound can and pack with crushed ice and 3/4 cup rock salt.  Have children roll on floor steadily for 10 minutes.  Take inner can out and wipe clean to prevent salt water from entering ice cream.  Stir contents slightly.  Remove water from outside can.  Replace inner can and re-pack with ice and 3/4 cup rock salt.  Have children roll 5 to 10 minutes more.  Serve.  (Be sure to wipe can before testing or serving to prevent salt water from getting into ice cream.)  Makes 4 to 5 small servings.
