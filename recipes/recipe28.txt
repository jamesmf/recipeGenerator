CHOCOLATE CHIP "PIZZA" COOKIE


1  c. butter or margarine
1  c. brown sugar
1  tsp. vanilla
2  c. flour
1/8  tsp. salt
1/2  c. chocolate chips
1/2  c. nuts

      Beat butter and sugar until fluffy; add vanilla.  Stir flour, salt, chocolate chips and nuts into beaten mixture.  Press into pizza pan.  Bake at 350 degrees; about 20 minutes, or until lightly browned.  Cool 15 or 20 minutes.  Turn out onto large tea towel.
      When completely cool, turn onto cardboard or the back of the pizza pan and decorate with tubes of frosting.  These turn out like the special occasion cookies available from bakeries.  Can be cut or broken into pieces to eat.
