SCARLETT'S FAVORITE POTATO ROLLS


1  pkg. active dry yeast
1 1/2  c. warm water
2/3  c. sugar
1 1/2  tsp. salt
2/3  c. shortening
2  eggs
1  c. mashed potatoes
7 to 7 1/2  c. all-purpose flour

      Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Stir in sugar, salt, shortening, eggs, potatoes and 4 cups of the flour.  Beat until smooth.  Mix in 3 to 3 1/2 more cups flour with spoon until easy to handle.  Knead dough until smooth and elastic on a lightly floured surface.  Place in a greased bowl and turn greased side up.  Cover tightly and refrigerate overnight.  (Dough can be kept up to 5 days covered and in refrigerator.)  Punch down dough, take out amount you need. Roll out dough and cut with a biscuit cutter.  Let rise about an hour.  Bake 15 minutes in 400 degrees; oven.
