AMISH TOMATOES


1  qt. canned tomatoes
2  Tbsp. oleo
3  Tbsp. brown sugar
3  Tbsp. flour

      Pick young, small okra pods, cut off each end and slice into 1/2-inch slices.  Roll okra in a mixture of 1 cup corn meal and 1/2 cup flour.  Heat 1/4 cup oil in an iron skillet.  Add okra and fry until golden brown, stirring often.  Sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper on when okra is about half done.  Add more oil if needed.
      Okra will not stay in the solid balls that pass for fried okra today, rather they will mix together like hash browns.  Be careful not to have the pan too hot, it will burn easily.
