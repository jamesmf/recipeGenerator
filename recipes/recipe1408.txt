MARINATED TURKEY


1  c. brown sugar
1  c. salt
1  gal. water
12 to 15  lb. turkey

      Put turkey in a plastic container.  Make enough brine so the turkey can be covered.  Put the turkey in the refrigerator for 1 or 2 days to cure in the brine.  Put on hot covered grill in a foil pan.  Keep a little water in the bottom of the pan at all times while it is cooking.  It will take about 4 hours to grill your turkey.
