GOOD CHICKEN


6  to 8 chicken breasts
2  c. buttermilk
1/4  c. lemon juice
4  tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1  tsp. garlic salt
2  tsp. paprika
4  tsp. seasoned salt
1/2  tsp. black pepper

      Combine ingredients. Pour over chicken breasts and marinate overnight. Drain thoroughly and roll in 1 3/4 cups of bread crumbs. Grease a pan well. Put in chicken. Spoon over it 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening (sometimes I use a little less). Put foil over all loosely for 45 minutes at 350 degrees;. Then put small amount of water in pan and bake another 20 minutes or until tender. (If you want the chicken more crisp or browner on the outside, put under broiler a few minutes.) Serve on warm platter surrounded with fresh parsley and tiny red crab apples. BEAUTIFUL! GOOD! EASY!
