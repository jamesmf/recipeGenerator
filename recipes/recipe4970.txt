BROCCOLI SALAD

Salad:
1-1/2  lb. broccoli florets
2  c. grated cheese
12  oz. bacon, cooked crisp
1/4  c. red onion, chopped
1  c. raisins

      Mix salad ingredients.  Mix dressing ingredients well.  (Do not add the dressing to the salad yet.)  Put both in the refrigerator until ready to serve.  When ready, toss the salad and dressing.  (You can divide up the recipe and use half for later. Divide the salad before putting on the dressing!  Add the dressing when ready to use.)
Dressing:
1  c. mayonnaise
4  Tbsp. vinegar
1/4 to 1/2  c. sugar
