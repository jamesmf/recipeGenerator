BRIGHT GREEN BEANS


1 (10 oz.)  pkg. frozen green beans, whole or cut into pieces
1/2  c. chicken stock or broth
1  Tbsp. onion, minced or 1 Tbsp. dried onion flakes

      Take your nonstick frying pan and spread the frozen beans over the bottom.  Add broth and onions and simmer over low heat until liquid evaporates.  Stir often so that beans cook evenly.  Don't cover the pan; beans cooked in a covered pan quickly lose their color and end up a sickly gray-green.  Beans should be crisp and tender by the time the water disappears.  If not cooked sufficiently, add a little more broth, but take care not to overcook.  Don't throw away the pan juices that remain; serve them over the beans.  Serves 3.
