DUMPLINGS MADE SIMPLE


2  c. self-rising flour
1  can cream of chicken soup
4  chicken breasts
1  Tbsp. salt

      Place chicken breasts in Dutch oven; cover with water. Add salt, more or less as desired. Cook in boiling water for about 2 hours; cool and remove meat from bones. Mix flour and cream of chicken soup together. Drop by tablespoons onto hot chicken pieces in broth. Cook slowly for 10 minutes, uncovered, then cook 10 minutes tightly covered. Remove dumplings and meat from broth; make gravy, if desired. Serve!
      Dip the spoon in the boiling liquid before scooping out the batter; less trouble getting dumpling batter to drop from spoon.
