PHEASANT WITH SAUTÉED APPLES


1/4  c. all-purpose flour
1  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
2  (1 1/2 to 3 lb.) ready to cook pheasants, cut up
6  Tbsp. butter or margarine
3/4  c. Sauterne
3/4  c. light cream
3  egg yolks
2  apples, cored and sliced into wedges
3  Tbsp. butter
1  tsp. sugar

      Combine flour, salt and pepper in a plastic bag.  Add 2 or 3 pheasant pieces at a time and shake to coat.  Brown pheasant lightly in butter or margarine.  Add wine.  Cover and simmer about 35 to 55 minutes, or until tender.  Remove pheasant to warm platter.  Beat cream with egg yolks.  Slowly stir into pan drippings.  Cook and stir over medium heat just until sauce is smooth and thickened.  Do not boil.  Pour sauce over pheasant. Garnish platter with sautéed apples.
      For sautéed apples, add apples to butter in medium skillet. Sprinkle with sugar and cook, turning often, until lightly browned. Makes 4 to 6 servings.
