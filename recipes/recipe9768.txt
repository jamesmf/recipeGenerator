TOFU STROGANOFF

Marinade:
1  lb. firm tofu
1/4  c. soy sauce
1/2  tsp. garlic powder
1/3  tsp. black pepper
1/3  tsp. cumin

 
Main Dish:
1  Tbsp. cornstarch
1  c. plain nonfat yogurt
1  tsp. olive oil
1  medium onion, minced
1/2  lb. mushrooms, sliced
1/2  tsp. basil
  dash of nutmeg
1/4  c. white wine
4  c. uncooked flat noodles

      At least 3 hours prior to mealtime, begin marinating the tofu; it can be marinated overnight. Cut tofu into 1/2-inch cubes and place in a small deep bowl. Add soy sauce, spices and enough water to cover. Mix well and put into the refrigerator until ready to prepare main dish.
      Begin heating water to cook noodles in a large pot. Drain tofu of marinade. Whisk cornstarch into yogurt. Heat the oil in a large nonstick frying pan. Cook onion in oil for 2 to 3 minutes; add tofu and mushrooms and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Add basil and nutmeg. Reduce heat, cover and cook for about 10 minutes. Begin cooking the noodles.
      When mushrooms are tender, add wine and yogurt-cornstarch mixture. Heat through over low heat. When noodles are done, drain in colander. Serve stroganoff over noodles.
