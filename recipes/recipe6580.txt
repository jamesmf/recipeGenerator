STUFFED CHICKEN BREAST


  boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1/4 to 1/2  lb. peppered ham, waffered
12  slices American cheese
2  cans cream of mushroom soup
1 small  pkg. slivered almonds
1/4  c. water
1  lb. bacon, sliced

      Lay chicken flat. Place 1/2 piece of ham on top, then 1/2 piece of cheese. Roll up and wrap 1/2 slice of bacon around rolled chicken. Secure with toothpick. Place in baking pan.
      Mix 2 cans of soup, 1/4 cup water and almonds until smooth. Pour over chicken. Cover and cook at 325 degrees; for 40 to 50 minutes or until tender. Remove cover and cook on broil until bacon browns, 7 to 10 minutes.
      I like to use chicken breast tenders and pound them flat.
