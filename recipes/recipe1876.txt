CHILAQUILES CON POLLO


1  (3 to 3 1/2 lb.) broiler-fryer
6  c. water
1  tsp. salt
4 (8 oz.)  pkg. corn tortillas
  vegetable oil
2 (10 3/4 oz.)  cans cream of mushroom soup (undiluted)
2 (10 3/4 oz.)  cans cream of chicken soup (undiluted)
2 (10 oz.)  cans tomatoes and green chilies
2 (16 oz.)  cans stewed tomatoes
1  fresh serrano chili or jalapeno pepper, broiled, peeled, seeded and chopped
4  medium onions, chopped
1  bunch green onions, chopped
1 1/2  tsp. ground cumin
5  c. (20 oz.) shredded Cheddar cheese
3  c. (12 oz.) shredded Monterey Jack cheese

      Place chicken in a Dutch oven; add water and salt.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, 1 1/2 hours or until tender. Remove chicken from broth.  Cool, bone and cut into bite size pieces.  Strain broth and set aside 1 1/3 cups.
      Using tongs, carefully arrange 3 tortillas in 1/8-inch deep hot oil in a large skillet.  Cook 3 to 5 seconds on each side.  Drain tortillas on paper towels.  Repeat cooking procedure with remaining tortillas; add oil to skillet if necessary.  Tear each tortilla into 8 pieces; set aside.  Reserve oil in skillet.
      Combine reserved broth, soup, tomatoes and green chilies, stewed tomatoes and serrano chili in a Dutch oven.  Simmer 30 minutes, stirring frequently.
      Saut√© onion, garlic powder and cumin in reserved oil until onion is tender, but not brown.  Stir onion and chicken into soup mixture.  Spread 1/4 of tortillas in 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking dish. Sprinkle half of Cheddar cheese over tortillas and pour 1/4 of sauce over cheese.  Spread 1/4 of tortillas over sauce.  Pour 1/4 of sauce over tortillas; sprinkle top with half of Monterey cheese.
      Repeat layering sequence in another 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking dish.  Bake casseroles at 350 degrees; for 20 to 30 minutes or until bubbly.  Yield:  24 servings.
      Note:  Casseroles may be frozen before baking; thaw completely and bake as directed.  To broil fresh chilies, place chilies on a baking sheet; broil 3 to 4-inches from heat, turning often with tongs, until blistered on all sides.  Immediately place chilies in a plastic bag; fasten securely and let steam 10 to 15 minutes.
      Remove peel of each chili and rinse under cold water after cutting a slit in side of chili.  This will remove seeds.  (Wear rubber gloves when rinsing and cutting chilies if you have sensitive skin.)  Remove stems, quarter each chili and set aside for adding to the soup mixture.
