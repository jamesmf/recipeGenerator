CINNAMON-SPICED PEACHES


1/2 (16 oz.)  pkg. frozen sliced peaches, thawed (about 2 c.)
1/4  c. dried cranberries (such as craisins; be sure to use the sweetened ones, the unsweetened ones are too tart for this recipe)
1/4  c. peach nectar (can be found in the International section at the grocery)
3  Tbsp. dark brown sugar
1/2  tsp. ground cinnamon

      Combine all ingredients in a medium nonstick skillet; stir well.  Cover and cook over medium heat 10 minutes or until peaches are tender.  Serve as a fruit side dish, a sauce for fat-free pound cake, angel food cake or low-fat vanilla ice cream or an accompaniment to ham or roast pork.
