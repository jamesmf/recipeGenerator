FRIED APPLE PIES

Dried Apples:

      Peel and slice any good, hard apples into even slices.  Granny Smith apples are a good example.  Spread apple slices on a cloth and let dry for 3 to 4 days, in the sun if possible.  They will look like leather when dry.  Be sure to take them in at night and don't let the dew fall on them!
      Store dried apples in a cool, dry place.  Mama used to put them into a flour sack or pillow case, she tied a knot in the top and she would then hang it up.
Filling:
1  c. dried apple slices
1  c. sugar
1  tsp. cinnamon
2  Tbsp. butter

      Wash apples slices and place in a heavy saucepan.  Cover with water.  Bring to a boil and lower heat.  Simmer until tender.  They soak up the water, so be sure to add more liquid if needed.  You can use apple juice instead of water.
      When done, stir in sugar, cinnamon and butter.  Let fruit cool.
Pastry:
1  c. flour
1/4  c. shortening or butter
1/4  c. water
  oil for frying

      Sift flour into bowl.  Cut in shortening or butter.  Stir in enough water to make a stiff dough.  Turn out dough onto a pastry cloth; knead gently.  Roll out dough; cut out 5-inch circles.  Put a couple of spoonfuls of filling onto pastry circle and fold over into a half moon shape, sealing pastry by pressing the tines of a fork down around the edges.  That part may be a little tricky if you've never seen a fried pie.
      Fry pies over medium heat, in an iron skillet until golden brown, turning often as they begin to brown.  You don't need a lot of oil in the pan, but you will have to add oil as they dry out. Drain pies on paper and serve hot or cold.
      Hint:  You can fill pies with other fillings, like peaches prepared like the apple filling.  Or you can make really thick chocolate pudding for filling.
