ONION SOUP


2  medium onions per person
  small piece of salt pork
  ground pepper
1 1/4  c. beef stock per person
  pinch of thyme
  Stilton or Blue cheese
  glass of wine or beer

      Saut√© the onions with the salt pork and season with pepper until the onions are golden, but not dark.  Put the onion mixture into a saucepan and add the stock and thyme.  Cover and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring on occasion.  Grate the cheese and add it to the soup after about 15 minutes of simmering.  Ten minutes before taking the soup off the heat, add a glass of wine or beer. Serve with croutons.  This is a quick soup that smells wonderful while it is simmering and is a way to use up ends of cheese and some wine or beer.
