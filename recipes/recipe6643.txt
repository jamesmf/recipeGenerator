EASY LOW COST EGGPLANT PARMIGIANA


2  eggplants (2-1/2 lb.) cut in 1/2 inch thick rounds
1/4  c. olive oil
3/4  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. pepper
1  jar (26 oz.) marinara sauce
1-1/2  c. (6 oz.) shredded part-skim Mozzarella cheese
1  c. grated Parmesan cheese
  Garnish - chopped parsley

      Remove the broiler pan with rack from the oven.  Have a shallow 2-1/2 quart baking dish ready.
      Broil eggplant in two batches.  Layer half the eggplant on the broiler rack and brush with half the oil, sprinkle with half the salt and pepper.  Broil four inches from the heat for six to eight minutes per side until lightly browned and tender.  Repeat with the rest of the eggplant.
      Spread 1/2 cup marinara sauce in the baking dish.  Line with half the eggplant.  Spoon on 1-1/4 cups of sauce; top with one cup Mozzarella.  Continue with remaining eggplant, marinara sauce and Mozzarella.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
      Cover with foil.  To keep foil from sticking to the cheese, use non-stick foil, or coat foil with non-stick spray.
      Bake at 350 degrees; for 45 minutes or until bubbly.  Let rest 15 minutes.   Garnish and serve.
