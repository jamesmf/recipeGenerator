HASH BROWN HOT DISH


1  c. diced ham
1/2  c. chopped onion
2  c. shredded cheese
1  pkg. O'Brien hash browns
1  can cream soup (I use cream of chicken)
1  c. sour cream
2  Tbsp. butter, melted

      Mix all ingredients together and bake in a shallow pan.  (Cake pan works well; do not use a casserole dish.)  Bake at 350 degrees; for 1 hour.
