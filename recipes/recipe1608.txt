BRAZILIAN BREAKFAST BLEND


1  ripe banana
2  Tbsp. Quaker oats (uncooked, straight out of the container; you may add more for a thicker texture)
  dash of cinnamon
  sweeten with honey, sugar (white or brown) or molasses

      Mash the banana with a fork to make a smooth texture.  Add oats and cinnamon and sweeten to taste.  Brazilian children eat this as an after school snack and they can easily make it by themselves.
