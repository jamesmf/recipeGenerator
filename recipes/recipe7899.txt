MURGH KE SHAMI


1-1/4  lb. boneless chicken
1/2  cup chana dal
2  one-inch pieces of ginger chopped
8  cloves of garlic, chopped
2  medium sized onions
2  Tbsp. cilantro leaves
2  Tbsp. mint leaves
2  tsp. lemon juice
3  Tbsp. oil, to pan-fry
1/2  tsp. cumin seeds
1/2  tsp. coriander seeds
  5-6 peppercorns
  3-4 large cardamoms
1  tsp. cayenne pepper
1  tsp. garam masala powder
1/2  tsp. each, mace and cardamom powders
  Salt to taste

      Wash the boneless chicken and drain out excess moisture. Soak chana dal for at least three hours.  Chop the onions, coriander leaves, mint leaves and mix them with lemon juice to make a stuffing.  Divide into sixteen equal portions and keep aside.
      Heat oil in a pan and add cumin seeds, coriander seeds, peppercorns and large cardamom.  Stir-fry for half a minute on medium heat.  Add chopped ginger, garlic and cayenne.  Add chicken and chana dal.  Add two cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cook covered until chana dal is completely cooked. Cook on high heat to dry out the mixture completely, stirring continuously.
       Remove from heat and cool.  Mince chicken and chana dal mixture to a smooth consistency.  Add garam masala powder, mace, cardamom powder and salt.
      Mix well and check the seasoning.  Divide into sixteen equal portions.  Flatten one portion in the palm of your hand and place a portion of onion stuffing in the center.  Shape into rounds and flatten slightly.  Similarly, shape the rest of the chicken mixture and fill with stuffing.  Pan-fry until golden brown, turning once.
      Serve hot with mint chutney.
      *If chicken mixture is too moist, add roasted gram flour (besan) or powdered roasted chana dal as per your requirement.
