CHOCOLATE BUTTER FUDGE CANDY


3  c. sugar
1  envelope unflavored gelatin
1  c. milk
1/2  c. light corn syrup (scant)
3  sq. unsweetened chocolate
1 1/4  c. margarine
1  tsp. vanilla
1  c. chopped nuts

      Mix sugar and dry gelatin in saucepan.  Add milk, syrup, chocolate and margarine and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until candy reaches 238 degrees; on candy thermometer or a few drops tested in cold water form a soft ball which flattens on removal from water.  (Candy will be much thicker than ordinary candy.)  Remove from heat; add vanilla and cool 15 minutes.  Beat until thick; stir in nuts and spread on buttered pan.  If candy is not hard enough, chill for an hour or so.
