CHINA TOWN EGG ROLLS


1  head cabbage, shredded
3  to 4 carrots, very thinly sliced
1/2  lb. ground beef
1/2  tsp. ground ginger
1 to 2  tsp. salt
2 to 3  tsp. sugar
3  tsp. black pepper
  egg roll skins
  Flour Paste

 
Flour Paste:
2  Tbsp. flour
2  Tbsp. water

	Boil cabbage and carrots in a large pot; drain. Boil ground beef until well cooked. Drain and combine with cabbage and carrots. Add spices to the mixture.
	In a large skillet, stir-fry the mixture in 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil until slightly crispy. Drain and allow to cool.
	 Lay out an egg roll skin with corner pointed toward you. Place about 1/4 to 1/3 cup mixture on egg roll skin and fold corner up over the mixture. Fold left and right corners toward the center and continue to roll.
	 Make a flour paste with flour and water. Brush a bit of the flour paste on the final corner to help seal the egg roll. Deep-fry in heated vegetable oil turning occasionally until golden brown. Remove from oil and drain well on paper towels.
