BEEF WITH WHEAT


1- 1 1/2  lb. boneless chuck
1/2-3/4  c. cracked wheat #2, washed, drained
1  can beef broth
  Salt, pepper, cumin

      Wash meat, pat dry.  Cover with water and bring to a boil. Cook 10 mins., discard water.  Add fresh water and boil meat until tender.  Shred meat, put back in water, add beef broth if needed for flavor.  Wash wheat, add to beef  with spices. Stir until wheat is cooked.  1-2 tbsp. of margarine or butter gives extra flavor.
      This can be made with chicken instead of beef.  (I always use a small onion or clove of garlic to initial water then discard).
