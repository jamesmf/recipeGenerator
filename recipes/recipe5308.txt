CHICKEN SOUP


12  oz. chicken breast strips (such as Perdue fresh, thin-sliced, skinless, boneless chicken breast tenderloins)
1  Tbsp. olive oil
1/2  c. diced onion (fresh or frozen)
1  Tbsp. jarred, chopped garlic
4  c. reduced-sodium chicken broth (such as College Inn)
2  c. water
4  oz. small pasta shells, noodles or orzo
1/2  lb. (2 c.) frozen mixed vegetables (such as a medley of carrots, green beans and peas)
1  Tbsp. dried parsley
1  tsp. dried basil
  freshly ground pepper to taste

      Slice chicken breast strips lengthwise, then cut into 1/2-inch pieces.  In a 4-quart saucepan, saut chicken in olive oil over medium-high heat until it begins to brown.  Add onions and garlic. Continue cooking and stirring constantly until the onions soften. Stir in the chicken broth and water.  Add pasta, bring to a boil and cook 5 minutes.  Stir in mixed vegetables, parsley, basil and pepper.  Return to boil, then simmer about 5 minutes or until vegetables are tender.  Makes 8 cups.
