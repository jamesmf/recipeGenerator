CHEESY POTATOES FOR THE BARBECUE


4  slices bacon
3  large baking potatoes
1  large onion, sliced
1  c. cubed processed cheese
3/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
1/2  tsp. dried leaf chervil
2  Tbsp. butter
1  Tbsp. bacon fat

      Fry bacon until crisp.  Drain on paper towel and crumble.  Peel and slice potatoes onto a large piece of double heavy-duty aluminum foil.  Add onions separated into rings.  Add bacon bits, cheese, salt, pepper and chervil and toss all together lightly.  Dot with butter and drizzle bacon fat over all.  Wrap foil loosely around the potatoes making double folds to seal well.  Cook about 4-inches from hot coals for 1 hour or until tender, turning the package often.  Note:  Bake in oven at 400 degrees; for about the same time, if desired.  Serves 4.
