MARY'S GARLIC CHEESE BALL


2  (8 oz.) packages cream cheese, softened
2  Tbsp. Mayonnaise
4  cloves garlic, minced
1/8  tsp. garlic salt
1  c. pecans, finely chopped
3/4  c. pecans, coarsely chopped

      Place a piece of foil wrap about 18 inches long onto counter top; place a piece of plastic wrap the same size over the foil. Leave these in place while you prepare the cheese ball.
      Mix cheese thoroughly with mayonnaise until smooth (electric mixer may be used).  Stir garlic, garlic salt and 1 c. pecans into cheese mixture by hand.   DO NOT BEAT.  Refrigerate until firm, about 3 hours or overnight.  Remove from refrigerator and shape into a ball.
      Place a 12 inch long piece of wax paper on countertop; sprinkle 3/4 c. pecans on wax paper.  Roll cheese ball over pecans to coat.  Place cheese ball on the prepared plastic wrap.  Roll plastic wrap over the cheese ball in a butcher roll;  roll foil wrap over this in a butcher wrap.  Refrigerate; remove at least 2 hours before serving.
      This will keep refrigerated about 1 week;  freezes well.  Thaw overnight in refrigerator or 3 to 4 hours on  countertop.  Unwrap and serve on a cheese board or plate surrounded by your favorite crackers.
      Note:  For better taste, prepare 2 to 3 days prior to serving.
