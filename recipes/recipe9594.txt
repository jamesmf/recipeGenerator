RICE AND PEAS ITALIAN STYLE
(Risi e Bisi)  

1  c. short grain rice
4  Tbsp. unsalted butter or olive oil
3  Tbsp. minced onion
2 1/2  c. chicken stock
1/2  c. white wine
2  lb. fresh peas, shelled or 1 1/2 c. frozen petite peas
4  oz. Prosciutto or ham, sliced, thin cut, julienne (optional)
1/2  c. freshly grated Parmesan cheese
  salt to taste
  freshly ground pepper
  freshly grated Parmesan cheese (for passing)

      Melt butter. Add onion and saut until soft, not golden brown. Stir in rice and saut until all rice is coated, about 2 minutes.  Add stock and wine; bring to a boil. Cover and reduce to low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender, but firm to the bite and most liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.
      While rice is cooking, cook peas (do not overcook).  Prepare ham if using. When rice is cooked, stir in peas, ham (if using) and cheese.  Salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately. Pass Parmesan cheese at the table.  Serves 4 as side dish or 2 as a light main course with a salad.
