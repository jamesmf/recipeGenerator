TUNA PECAN BAKE


1  can cream of mushroom soup (condensed)
1/3  c. milk
1 (7 oz.)  can tuna, drained
1  c. frozen baby peas
1/2  c. buttered breadcrumbs
1/2  c. chopped pecans
1 (5 oz.)  pkg. noodles, cooked

      Combine mushroom soup, milk, tuna and peas. Fold in noodles and pour into greased quart casserole. Mix together equal parts of buttered breadcrumbs and pecans. Sprinkle evenly over top of casserole. Bake at 350 degrees; for 30 minutes.
      Note: This recipe doubles well, just use larger casserole to bake. If you do double, use 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can cream of celery soup.
