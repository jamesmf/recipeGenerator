BASIC COCKTAIL SAUCE


1 (12 oz.)  bottle chili sauce (Del Monte is my favorite)
1 (5 oz.)  bottle prepared horseradish (red lid)
1  c. ketchup
4  Tbsp. lemon juice
2  tsp. worcestershire sauce
2 to 3  drops Tabasco, or to taste

      Mix thoroughly.  Chill.  Serve with cooked shrimp or other seafoods.  Recipe is enough to serve with 5 lbs. cooked shrimp. Can be frozen.
