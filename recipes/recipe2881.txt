7-POUND CHRISTMAS FUDGE


3  large (8 oz.) bars milk chocolate, broken in small pieces
2 (11.5 oz.)  pkg. milk chocolate bits
1 large (13 oz.)  jar Marshmallow Creme
4  c. sugar
1 tall (13 oz.)  can evaporated milk
1/2  lb. butter
2  tsp. vanilla
1  c. chopped black walnuts, walnuts or pecans

      In large mixing bowl of heavy-duty electric mixer, combine broken chocolate bars, chocolate bits and Marshmallow Creme; set aside.  In large heavy saucepan, combine sugar, evaporated milk and butter.  Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture boils; boil 5 minutes.  Pour hot mixture over chocolate mixture.  Beat until ingredients are thoroughly blended; beat in vanilla.  Remove beater and stir in chopped nuts.  Quickly pour mixture into buttered 9 x 13 x 2-inch pan.  Cool.  Cover tightly and refrigerate until firm enough to cut into small squares.  (Flavor will be best after a week or two of storage.)  Makes about 7 pounds fudge.
