FRIED PORK CHOPS


6  center chops or other cut
  salt to taste
  rubbed sage
  flour
6 to 8  Tbsp. Crisco

      Sprinkle rubbed sage on each chop; coat well with flour.  In large frying pan, place the Crisco.  Get Crisco hot.  Place chops in hot Crisco for 1 1/2 minutes.  Turn chops over; chops will brown better in hot Crisco.  Reduce heat and cook until done.
      Note:  Chicken will brown better if placed in hot shortening of any kind and, when turned, brown won't come off.  Cook slowly after browning both sides.
