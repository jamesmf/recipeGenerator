RAISIN CAKE


1  pkg. raisins
2  c. sugar
2  c. water
1  Tbsp. butter
1  Tbsp. Spry
2  eggs
2  tsp. nutmeg
2  tsp. cinnamon
2  tsp. allspice
2  tsp. baking soda
  about 3 lb. flour

      In a large pot, bring to a boil the raisins, sugar, water, butter and Spry.  Do not stir!!!  Remove from stove; set aside to cool.  After this is cool, then stir in the eggs and spices.  Now fold in about half the flour, then the baking soda.  Now just keep adding flour until you get the right texture for a cake dough. Bake at 350 degrees; about 50 minutes or until lightly touched with fingertip doesn't leave depression.  I like to use this as a base for my fruit cake, by adding fruits and nuts after dough is ready.
