1 (1 lb.)  pkg. frozen raw ground turkey, thawed
1/4  c. minced fresh parsley

      Combine chicken broth, tomato sauce and dried whole oregano in a small bowl.  Stir well and set aside.  Combine turkey, parsley, poultry seasoning, pepper and garlic in a medium bowl.  Stir until well blended.  Divide mixture into 4 equal portions shaping each into a 1/2 inch thick oval patty.  Sprinkle breadcrumbs on a sheet of wax paper.  Press patties in breadcrumbs, lightly coating each side.  Place patties in a shallow baking dish coated with vegetable cooking spray.  Bake at 450 degrees; for 8 minutes; drain.  Turn patties over and spoon tomato mixture evenly over patties.  Bake an additional 8 minutes or until sauce is bubbly.  Sprinkle patties with cheese and bake 1 additional minute or until cheese is melted. Garnish with parsley.
