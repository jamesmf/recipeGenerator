OMELETTE WITH CREAMED MUSHROOMS


4  eggs
2  Tbsp. water
  salt and pepper

 
For the Mushrooms:
1.1  lb. button mushrooms or chanterelles
2  Tbsp. butter
2  Tbsp. flour
1.6  c. single cream
  lemon juice
  salt and white pepper

      Clean the mushrooms.  Cut them into thin slices and add some drops of lemon juice.  Melt the butter.  Add the mushrooms and fry quickly.  Sprinkle in the flour.  Stir and add the cream.  Bring to a boil, stirring all the time.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
      Break the yolks with a fork.  Pour in the water and add salt and pepper.  Brown half of the butter in the frying pan.  Pour in the egg mixture and stir with a fork.  When the top of the omelette is creamy in texture and the bottom is golden brown, fold it in the frying pan.  Pour the creamed mushrooms onto a serving dish and turn the omelette out over them.
