SPICY PICKLES


1  to 2 garlic cloves
46  oz. (1 large jar) dill pickles, whole
5  oz. (1 bottle) Tabasco sauce
5  lb. sugar

      Peel and split garlic cloves.  Empty juice out of pickle jar. Slice pickles into thin slices.  Using the pickle jar, layer ingredients as follows:
       Layer some sliced pickles in bottom of jar.   Add some garlic, many drops of Tabasco sauce and approximately 1 cup sugar. Repeat layers until jar is full.  You should use all of the pickles, garlic, tabasco sauce and most (or all) of the sugar.
      Put the lid tightly on the jar.  Lay the jar on its side. Turn 1/4 turn every day for 10 days.  Pickles will be ready after the tenth day.  This recipe will make its own juice.  If desired, you can split into smaller jars.
