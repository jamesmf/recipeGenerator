MARYLAND CRAB DIP


1  lb. crabmeat, picked (canned works well, too)
1/2  bottle capers, drained
2  c. mayonnaise
2  small onions, grated
  Worcestershire sauce to taste (about 4 shakes)
2  c. Cheddar cheese, grated

      Mix all ingredients together except 1 cup of cheese.  Place mixture in 10-inch Pyrex dish (pie plate). Cover with remaining cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees; until cheese bubbles, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Serve hot. Serve with crackers.
