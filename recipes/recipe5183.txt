QUICK AND EASY ALFREDO SAUCE


1/2  cup butter
1 (8 oz.)  package cream cheese
2  tsp. garlic powder
2  cups whole milk
6  oz. grated Parmesan cheese
1/8  tsp. ground black pepper
1  tsp. lemon pepper seasoning
4  Tbsp. fresh parsley, chopped

      Melt butter in a medium, non-stick saucepan over medium heat. Add cream cheese and garlic powder, stirring with wire whisk until smooth. Add milk, a little at a time, whisking to smooth out lumps. Stir in Parmesan, pepper, lemon-pepper and parsley. Remove from heat when sauce reaches desired consistency. Sauce will thicken rapidly upon cooling; thin with milk if cooked too long. Toss with hot pasta to serve.
