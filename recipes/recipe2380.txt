BLACKBERRY COBBLER


4  c. fresh blackberries
1  c. sugar
2  Tbsp. water
1/2  c. shortening
2  c. self-rising flour
1/2  c. cold water

      Combine first 3 ingredients in saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves; set aside.  Cut shortening into flour with pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Sprinkle cold water (1 tablespoon at a time) evenly over surface; stir with a fork until dry ingredients are moistened. Roll about 2/3 of pastry into a 14 x 10-inch rectangle.  Fit pastry into lightly greased 10 x 6 x 2 baking dish.  Spoon in blackberry mixture.  Roll remaining pastry out and cut into strips.  Arrange strips over blackberry filling in lattice pattern.  Bake at 425 degrees; for 25 minutes or until golden brown.
