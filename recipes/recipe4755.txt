PASTA SALAD WITH SHRIMP


1  lb. pkg. linguine
1/4  c. plus 1 Tbsp. olive oil, divided
1  Tbsp. margarine
1  lb. cleaned shrimp
1  garlic clove, minced
3  Tbsp. lemon juice
  dash of cayenne pepper
1  red or green pepper, cut in 1-inch matchstick pieces
1  red onion, thinly sliced
12  small black olives, chopped
1/2  c. chopped parsley
1  Tbsp. chopped fresh basil or 1 tsp. dried
1  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. black pepper
3  tomatoes, cut in wedges

      Cook linguine according to package directions. Drain, rinse with cold water and drain again.
      In a large bowl, toss linguine with 1/4 cup olive oil, coating well. Reserve.
      Wash shrimp and pat dry. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the 1 tablespoon margarine with remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Add shrimp and garlic; cook, stirring often, 5 minutes or until shrimp are pink and tender. Remove from heat. Add cayenne and lemon juice to shrimp; marinate about 30 minutes.
      Combine remaining ingredients, except tomatoes, with linguine. Add shrimp mixture. Toss well. Chill; toss again just before serving. Garnish with tomato wedges. Makes 10 servings, about 1 cup each.
Tips:

      Serve with baked tomatoes and crusty bread.
      To avoid mushy pasta, select dry pasta products made with 100% durum wheat or semolina flour.
