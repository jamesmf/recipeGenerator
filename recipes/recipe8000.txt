PIEROGI
(Polish Dish)  
Dough:
2  c. flour (approximately)
2  eggs
1/2  c. water

      In large bowl, beat eggs and water.  Add flour slowly. Continue to add flour till dough is a soft mass.  Turn out onto a floured board and knead till dough becomes smooth.  Wrap in plastic wrap and store in refrigerator no less than 30 minutes. Take out about 1/3 of dough at a time.  Roll out on floured board as thin as possible, then cut into 3 inch circles.  Do not reroll any leftover dough, it gets tough.  Put 1 tablespoon or more of your chosen filling, fold over and seal.  Repeat till you have all circles filled.  Drop Pierogi into lightly salted boiling water. Cook till Pierogi floats.  Lift out with slotted spoon.  Saut√© in melted butter till desired brownness.
