GRILLED THREE CHEESE POTATOES


6  large potatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick
2  medium onions, chopped
1/3  c. Parmesan cheese
1  c. shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1  c. Mozzarella cheese, divided
1  lb. sliced bacon, cooked and crumbled or bacon bits
1/4  c. butter or margarine, cubed
1  Tbsp. minced or dried chives
1 to 2  tsp. seasoning salt
1/2  tsp. pepper

      Divide the potatoes and onions equally between 2 pieces of heavy-duty foil that have been coated with nonstick cooking spray. Combine Parmesan cheese and 3/4 cup each Cheddar and Mozzarella. Sprinkle cheese over potatoes and onions. Top with bacon, butter, chives, salt and pepper. Bring opposite ends of foil together over filling and fold down several times. Fold unsealed ends toward filling and crimp tightly. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 35 to 40 minutes or potatoes are tender. Remove from grill. Open foil and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
      Can be cooked in oven at 350 degrees; for 1 hour.
