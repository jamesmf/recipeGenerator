FRIED PECANS


6  C. water
4  c. pecan halves (1 lb.)*
  Salt
1/2  c. sugar
24  oz. vegetable oil

      Preparation:  Measure and have all ingredients ready.  Pour oil in skillet; set aside.  Spread clean cloth on countertop for draining.  Have salt shaker nearby.  Set up colander in sink.
      Pour water into a 4-quart saucepan; bring to a boil.  Add pecans and allow to return to a boil.  Cook 1 minute.  Drain by pouring pecans in a large colander;  immediately rinse under hot water   sink sprayer works;  drain well.  Combine warm pecans and sugar in a large mixing bowl;  stir until the sugar dissolves.
      Heat 1 inch of oil to 350 degrees; in skillet.  Fry pecans in oil 5 minutes or until golden brown, stirring and turning often.  DO NOT OVERCOOK.  Cook a few nuts first as a test...they burn easily.
      Drain on clean cloth on counter;  do not allow pecans to touch if possible.  Sprinkle lightly with salt.  Cool.  Pecans tend to stick to the cloth.  Peel them off gently so as to keep lint off the nuts.  Store cooled nuts in a tightly covered container. Yield:  4 cups.
      *Walnut halves may be substituted.
