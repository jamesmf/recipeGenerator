COCIDO


1/2  lb. chorizo, sliced 1/4-inch
1 1/2  lb. stew meat (in small cubes)
1  large Spanish onion, coarsely chopped
2  medium carrots, thinly sliced
1 (1 lb.)  can tomatoes
2  Tbsp. instant beef granules in 4 to 5 c. water
1  can chickpeas (I use frozen black-eyed peas)
3/4 to 1  lb. yams (in small cubes), steamed
  salt and pepper to taste

      In 5-quart saucepan lightly brown chorizo.  Remove with slotted spoon.  To drippings in pan add stew meat.  Just before it is finished browning, add onions; stir to brown lightly.  Add chorizo, carrots, tomatoes and beef bouillon.  Simmer covered until beef is tender and carrots done.  Skim off some of the fat.  Add peas and steamed yams plus their juices, salt and pepper.  Reheat.
