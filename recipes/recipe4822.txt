WEDDING SOUP
(Minestra de Scarola)  

1  large head escarole
3  c. water
2  Tbsp. fresh parsley
1/4  c. freshly grated Romano cheese
1  c. freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4  lb. ground beef
1/8  lb. ground veal
1/8  lb. ground pork
1/4  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. pepper
1/4  tsp. oregano
1/4  tsp. basil
1  egg
1/4  c. bread crumbs
4  qt. chicken, beef or holiday broth

      Wash escarole under cold running water.  Be sure to open the leaves to get out any hidden grit.  Place a large size pot over medium-high heat.  Add water and escarole and boil for 10 minutes or until done.  Drain and allow to cool.  When cool, chop into small pieces and set aside.  While escarole is cooling, chop parsley into fine pieces and grate cheeses.
      In a large mixing bowl, combine beef, veal, pork, parsley, cheeses, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, egg and bread crumbs.  Mix well and shape into 1/4 to 1/2-inch balls.  Place broth in 6-quart pot over medium-high heat and bring to a rolling boil.  Add meatballs; cover and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add escarole; lower heat and simmer an additional 10 minutes.  Serve with additional freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  Serves 10 to 12.
      Note:  If you want to add a small pastina, add 1/2 cup 2 or 3 minutes after adding meatballs.
