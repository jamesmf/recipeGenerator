AN "OLD TIME" LEMON TAFFY


2  c. white sugar
1  c. boiling water
1/2  c. butter (no substitute)
1/2  c. vinegar

      Put all ingredients at once in a pan and cook to a hard-ball stage, tested in ice cold water.  When cooked sufficiently, add 1 teaspoon lemon extract.  Stir just enough to blend in.  Immediately pour on buttered plates to cool.  This needs no stretching, but it should be very hard and brittle.  This is very good.
