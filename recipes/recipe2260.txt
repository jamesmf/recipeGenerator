MAMAW'S CHICKEN PIE


1  (3 lb.) chicken
2  c. water
1  Tbsp. salt

      Boil chicken in large deep pot in salted water until tender. Remove bones and skin; cut into bite sized pieces and place in a well-greased 3-quart casserole (Pyrex 9 x 13-inch dish is ideal).
Sauce:
3  Tbsp. butter, melted
3  Tbsp. flour
1 1/2  c. milk
1 1/2  c. chicken broth
1  Tbsp. lemon juice
1  Tbsp. instant minced onion

      Make sauce by blending flour into melted butter and adding milk, chicken broth, lemon juice and minced onion.  Cook over medium heat until slightly thick.  Pour over chicken.  Top with Pinwheel Crust.
Pinwheel Crust:
1 1/2  c. flour
2  tsp. baking powder
1/2  tsp. salt
3  Tbsp. shortening
1/2  c. milk
1 large  jar chopped pimientos, drained
1 to 1 1/2  c. Cheddar cheese, grated

      Will need 32 pinwheels to cover pie.
      Sift dry ingredients together.  Cut in shortening and add all of milk at once.  Stir just enough to mix.  Roll out to 1/4-inch thickness on floured board.  Spread chopped pimientos and cheese over pastry.  Roll in jelly roll fashion and slice into pieces about 3/4-inch thick.  Place rounds on top of chicken and sauce. Bake at 350 degrees; for about 30 minutes or until brown and bubbly. Serves 8 to 12.  Freezes well.
