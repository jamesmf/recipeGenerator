ASPARAGUS BAKED IN FOIL


1  lb. asparagus, washed and trimmed
  salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
2  tsp. lemon juice
1/4  c. strong chicken broth
  parsley and lemon rind (for garnish)

      Preheat the oven to 400 degrees;.  Place the asparagus in the center of a large sheet of aluminum foil in a baking pan with the edges folded up to keep the liquid inside.  Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with lemon juice and pour the broth over all.  Fold the sides over and seal.  Bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until the asparagus are al dente, just cooked.  Place the asparagus on a platter and pour the juice over.  Serve immediately, garnished with parsley and lemon rind.  Serves 4.
