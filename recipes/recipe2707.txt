LEG OF LAMB


5  lb. leg of lamb

 
Marinade:
1  Tbsp. fresh black pepper
1  Tbsp. fresh rosemary or 1 1/2 tsp. dried
1/2  c. fresh mint leaves
5  crushed garlic cloves
1/2  c. red wine vinegar
1/4  c. soy sauce
1/2  c. dry red wine

      If lamb is frozen, defrost in refrigerator (so it will re-absorb juices as it thaws).  Trim off as much excess fat as possible.  Submerge lamb in marinade for 8 hours, turning occasionally.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees; and wait at least 15 minutes before putting the lamb in.  Roast at 450 degrees; for 15 minutes; reduce heat to 325 degrees; and roast 15 minutes per pound for rare and 30 minutes per pound for well done.  Let it set 10 to 20 minutes before carving.
      Strain fat from drippings and use drippings, bones and leftover meat for stew.  Serves 6 to 8.
