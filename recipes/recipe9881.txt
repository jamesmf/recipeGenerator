NANA'S BAKED BEANS


1  lb. dry navy beans
1 1/2  tsp. salt
4  qt. cold water, divided
1  c. chopped red onion
1/2  c. molasses
6  bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
1/4  c. packed brown sugar
1  tsp. ground mustard
1/4  tsp. pepper

      In a large saucepan, bring beans, salt and 2 quarts water to a boil; boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Let stand for 1 hour. Drain beans and discard liquid. Return beans to pan. Cover with remaining water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until beans are tender. Drain, reserving liquid. In a greased 2 1/2-quart baking dish, combine beans, 1 cup liquid, onion, molasses, bacon, brown sugar, mustard and pepper. Cover and bake at 325 degrees; for 3 to 3 1/2 hours or until beans are as thick as desired, stirring occasionally. Add more of the reserved cooking liquid if needed. Yield: 12 to 16 servings.
