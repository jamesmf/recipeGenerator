FESTIVE MAKE-AHEAD PASTA SALAD


1 1/2  c. medium-size macaroni shells
1  Tbsp. vegetable oil
2  c. shredded iceberg lettuce
4  hard-cooked eggs, sliced
  pepper to taste
12  oz. cooked ham, cut in thin strips (or 1 c. each of ham and hard salami, cut in thin strips)
1  pkg. (10 oz.) frozen tiny green peas, thawed
1  c. (4 oz.) coarsely shredded Monterey Jack or cheddar cheese
  For garnish: 2 Tbsp. chopped fresh parsley

      Cook macaroni shells according to package directions; rinse and drain.  Toss macaroni with oil to prevent shells sticking together.

Spread dressing carefully over the top to edge of bowl.  Cover tight with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.  Before serving, sprinkle with parsley.  Toss salad at table before serving.  Makes 6 servings.
