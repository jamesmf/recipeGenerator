POTATO SOUP


1  large onion
5  large potatoes
2  Tbsp. margarine
3  c. milk
1  c. water
2  tsp. salt
  pepper to taste

      Chop onions and cut potatoes in small pieces.  In a large pot, melt margarine and cook onions until tender.  Add water and potatoes.  Cover and boil gently, about 15 minutes, or until potatoes are fork tender.  Partly mash potatoes up with fork without draining them.  Add milk, salt and pepper.  Heat slowly, stir to keep from sticking.  Do not boil.  Serves about 6.
