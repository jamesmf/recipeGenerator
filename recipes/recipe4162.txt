SNOW PEAS WITH CURRY FILLING


2  doz. fresh snow pea pods
1/8  lb. deli roast beef, sliced paper thin
4  oz. (1/2 of 8 oz. pkg.) cream cheese, softened
1/4  c. sour cream
1  tsp. curry powder
1/2  tsp. garlic powder
1/4  tsp. granulated sugar

      Trim stem and remove strings from sides of each pod.  Blanch pea pods in lightly salted, boiling water 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain and rinse in cold water.  Using a sharp knife, slit each pea pod open  along straight edge.
      Cut 24 (2 x 3-inch) pieces from roast beef.  In a small bowl, combine remaining ingredients.  Spread about 1 teaspoon of filling in each pea pod; tightly roll a piece of roast beef and insert into pod. Refrigerate 1 hour or until firm.  Yield:  About 2 dozen snow peas.
