JERKY


1  1/2 lbs. flank steak (beef, venison, etc.)
1/4  C. Worchestershire sauce
1/2  tsp. garlic salt
1/3  tsp. pepper
1/4  C. soy sauce
1  tsp. liquid smoke
1  tsp. onion powder
1/3  tsp. salt

      Remove all fat from meat and cut with grain into 1/4-inch thick strips.  (partly frozen cuts easier) Place meat in flat pan.  Mix all ingredients and pour over meat.
      Marinate for 24 hours.  Remove meat and place on paper towel to absorb extra sauce.  Hang meat over oven racks with tin foil or pan placed beneath to protect from drippings.  DO NOT bake, just dry meat by putting oven on very lowest temperature setting (approximately 170 degrees) and leave oven door slightly open.
      Dry for 10  hours.
