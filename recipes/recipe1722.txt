SHEKH MEHSHEE
(Stuffed Eggplant)  

6  Japanese eggplants (skinnier than traditional eggplants)
1/2  lb. extra-lean ground lamb or beef
1  small chopped onion
1  tsp. Middle Eastern spice
1/2  tsp. salt
2  Tbsp. vegetable oil
1 (8 oz.)  can tomato sauce
1/2  tsp. salt
1  c. water
1  small sliced tomato

      Wash the eggplants and remove the green tops.  Core them, using a coring knife (chop and save the core material).  Set aside.  In a medium size bowl, mix the ground lamb (or beef), onion, spice and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  With a teaspoon, fill each eggplant with the meat mixture.  Press stuffing in well.  On a cooking sheet lined with greased aluminum foil, place the chopped core material and the stuffed eggplants in rows.  Lightly brush eggplants with vegetable oil.  Bake in a 400 degrees; oven for 30 minutes or until soft.
      Note:  You may serve the cooked eggplants now on a bed of rice or continue with the recipe.
      Remove eggplants from oven and place in a 9 x 9-inch (or similar size) cooking pan.  Pour tomato sauce on top of eggplants. Add the remaining salt and water.  Garnish with the core material and then cover with the sliced tomatoes.  Bake in a 375 degrees; oven for 45 minutes or until stew becomes thick and bubbly.  (Add more water if needed.)  Serve with rice or bread.
