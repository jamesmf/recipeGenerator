SOFT BEEF TACOS


1  lb. ground beef
1  small onion, minced
2  cloves garlic, minced
1/2  green pepper, chopped
1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1  c. water
1  tsp. ground cumin
1  tsp. chili powder
1/2  tsp. dried whole oregano
1/4  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. pepper
8  (7-inch) flour tortillas
2  c. shredded lettuce
2  tomatoes, chopped
1  c. (4 oz.) shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (8 oz.)  carton commercial guacamole
  commercial taco or picante sauce

      Cook first 5 ingredients in a large skillet until meat is browned, stirring to crumble. Drain well. Stir in water, cumin, chili powder, oregano, salt and pepper. Cover and simmer over low heat 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Uncover and cook 8 to 10 minutes.
       Wrap tortillas securely in aluminum foil. Bake at 350 degrees; for 10 minutes or until thoroughly heated. Spoon about 1/8 of meat mixture lengthwise down center of a tortilla. Top with about 1/8 each of lettuce, tomato, cheese, guacamole and desired amount of taco sauce. Fold bottom third of tortilla over filling. Fold sides of tortilla in toward center, leaving top open. Secure with wooden picks, if necessary. Repeat with remaining tortillas and fillings. Serve with additional taco sauce, if desired. Yield: 8 tacos.
