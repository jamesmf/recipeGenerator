COCA-COLA CHICKEN
(Pork Is Good Too)  

4 to 6  Tbsp. oil
4  chicken breasts (boneless and skinless) or 4 pork chops
1  can Coca-Cola or any dark soda
1/2  c. ketchup

	Lightly brown the meat in a small amount of oil.  Add the soda; do not cover meat (about halfway).  Cover and cook on medium heat about 10 to 15 minutes, turn meat and cook another 10 to 15 minutes (until done).  Add ketchup, mixing with remaining sauce. Remove cover and cook 10 minutes or until chicken is done.	Sauce should be thick.  Add more ketchup if necessary.
	The soda tenderizes the meat and the ketchup adds a sweet barbecue sauce flavor.
