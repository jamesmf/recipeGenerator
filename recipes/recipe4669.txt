RUSSIAN DRESSING


  Mayonnaise
  Chili Sauce
  Lemon Juice
  Worcestershire  Sauce
  Horseradish

      Take a heaping tablespoon of mayonnaise (as much as you need for the salad).  Enough chili sauce to cover the mayonnaise, stir it thoroughly to make a nice shrimp color, squeeze lemon over the mixture, along with a few drops of worcestershire sauce, stir thoroughly.  Horseradish is optional, it is great if you like your dressing tangy.
