OVEN BAKED CHICKEN PAPRIKASH


8  pieces chicken (boned preferred)
  paprika
  salt
  cayenne pepper
1  medium onion, chopped
3  bay leaves
  water
1  c. sour cream
2  Tbsp. flour
  broth from chicken

      Sprinkle chicken heavy with paprika, lightly with salt and cayenne pepper.  Place in roaster; spread onions on top.  Add bay leaves.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 45 minutes.  Stir chicken once during this 45 minutes.  When chicken is browned, add enough water to just cover the chicken. Stir chicken so the paprika is blended into water.  Return to oven to blend flavors, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Blend together sour cream and flour and slowly add broth from chicken.  When blended, slowly add broth in roaster.  Stir to thicken for 15 minutes.  Serve with noodles.
