SAUERBRATEN


4  lb. bottom sirloin butt or center cut crossrib, trimmed
2  tsp. salt
2  Tbsp pickling spices
2  tsp. salt
  red wine vinegar (enough to cover meat)
1  or 2 onions, sliced

	Place meat, pickling spices, salt and vinegar in large pan or bowl.  Let stand in refrigerator 4 to 6 days.  Turn meat daily. Transfer meat into roasting pan.  Cover and cook at low heat (325 degrees;) until nearly tender, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Last 1/2 hour add onions.  Thicken juice with flour to desired consistency using some of the marinade.  Meat may be sliced and placed with gravy in roasting pan and reheated when desired.  It will not crumble like ordinary pot roast.  Serve with red cabbage, or sauerkraut and potato pancakes for a German meal.	Serves 6.
