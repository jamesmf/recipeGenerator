2  Tbsp. flour
1/4  c. water

      Melt margarine. Saut√© leeks and celery. Pour in chicken broth and water. Add potatoes and parsley. Simmer 1 hour. Add milk and simmer 15 minutes. Blend flour into 1/4 cup water and stir into soup. Simmer another 15 minutes, stirring frequently.
      Notice that I never put a high heat under this.  It takes longer to cook, but it does not stick on the bottom.
