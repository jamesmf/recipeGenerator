CHEESY EGGPLANT GRILL


1  slice eggplant, 1/2-inch thick
1  slice onion
1  slice tomato
  salt, pepper and oregano to taste
1  slice Mozzarella cheese

      Layer all ingredients, starting with eggplant and ending with Mozzarella.  Place in foil.  Make a ball of foil and close loosely on top, so it does not stick to cheese.  Bake on barbecue, lid down for 10 minutes.
