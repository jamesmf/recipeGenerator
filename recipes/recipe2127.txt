MARSHMALLOW PECAN CANDIES


1 (12 oz.)  pkg. peanut butter pieces
2  Tbsp. butter flavor shortening
24  large marshmallows
48  pecan halves (4 oz.)
3/4  c. almonds (unblanched)
1/2  c. sugar

      Put the sugar and nuts into a heavy-based saucepan over medium heat and stir until the sugar starts to melt.  Continue to cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until the sugar is a dark caramel color.  Dip the bottom of the pan quickly into cold water to stop the cooking; remove immediately.  Drop small spoonfuls of the nut mixture (about 3 to 4 nuts in each) onto an oiled baking sheet.  Allow to cool, then transfer immediately to an airtight container.  Layer with wax paper and keep tightly sealed.  Yield: 1 to 1 1/2 dozen candies.
