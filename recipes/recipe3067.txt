MONTEREY JACK AND JALAPENO TURNOVERS


6  Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted
2  tsp. finely minced cilantro
1  c. Monterey Jack, shredded
1/4  tsp. cumin seeds, toasted
1  Tbsp. minced pickled jalapenos
1  scallion, minced
16  slices white bread, crusts removed

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;. Melt butter with minced cilantro. Roll out bread between 2 pieces of waxed paper until very thin. Brush bread lightly on both sides with melted butter mixture.
      In a bowl, combine cheese, cumin, peppers and scallions. Place some of the filling, about 1 heaping teaspoonful, in the center of each slice. Fold, making a triangle shape. Trim edges. Press edges with your fingers to tightly seal. Brush tops and bottoms with melted butter and crimp edges with fork. Place on parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve with salsa dipping sauce.
