MEXICAN CARAMEL CUSTARD
(Calabacitas Guisadas)  

3/4  c. sugar
4  c. whole milk
1/2  c. sugar
1  (2-inch) piece cinnamon stick
4  eggs
4  egg yolks

      Heat the 3/4 cup sugar in a small skillet over low heat until it begins to dissolve.  Increase the heat slightly so sugar will caramelize.  When it has reached the caramel color, pour into a 3-quart baking dish, quickly tipping the dish so the caramel will coat all sides; set aside.  Place the milk, sugar and cinnamon stick in a saucepan and bring slowly to boil, stirring, until the sugar dissolves.
      Cook over medium heat until the mixture has reduced slightly. Set aside to cool.  Heat oven to 350 degrees;.  Place a dish large enough to accommodate the baking dish on the middle shelf of the oven. Add approximately 2-inches of water.  In a large bowl, beat the eggs and egg yolks well.  Discard the cinnamon stick and add the milk to the eggs.  Beat well.  Pour into the baking dish.  Place the baking dish in the water bath.  Bake for approximately 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Test for doneness; cake tester should come out clean. Serve warm.
