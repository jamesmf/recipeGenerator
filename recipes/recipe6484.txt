BUTTER BEANS AND HAM


1  lb. large butter beans or baby lima beans
1  (14 oz.) ham hock or ham shank
2  medium size yellow onions (1 quartered, 1 finely chopped)
3  cloves garlic, peeled
2  bay leaves
1  Tbsp. unsalted butter or margarine
1 1/2  tsp. hot red pepper sauce
1/2  tsp. each salt and black pepper

      Half fill a large saucepan with water and stir in the beans, ham hock, the quartered onion, garlic and bay leaves.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour or until the beans are tender.  Drain the beans, reserving all of the liquid and discarding the onions, garlic and bay leaves.  Transfer the beans to a bowl and the ham hock to a cutting board.  Cut the meat into small pieces.  Discard the bone.
      In the same saucepan, melt the butter over moderate heat.  Add the chopped onion and saut for 5 minutes or until tender.  Stir in the ham and enough reserved bean liquid to make the beans soupy; bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes.  Stir in the beans, red pepper sauce, salt and black pepper.  Heat for 3 minutes or until hot.
