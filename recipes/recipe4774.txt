CORN SALAD


1  can Shoe Peg corn (white)
1  can French-style green beans
1  can LeSueur green peas
1  c. green pepper, chopped
1/2  c. pimento, chopped
1/2  c. onion, chopped

 
Dressing:
1/2  c. salad oil
3/4  c. sugar
  salt and pepper
3/4  c. vinegar
3  Tbsp. sweet pickle relish

      Drain corn, green beans, peas and pimento. Pour dressing over the vegetables and let stand overnight. Drain off dressing (save to use later) just before serving. (Dressing keeps for several weeks in the refrigerator. Good on slaw also.) Serves 8 to 10.
