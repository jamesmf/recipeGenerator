DANISH APPLE CAKE


3  lb. apples (not too sweet)
10  oz. sugar
10  oz. dried breadcrumbs
7  oz. butter
1/4 to 1/2  pt. whipping cream

      Grease an ovenproof dish and line with a layer of breadcrumbs. Dot with lumps of butter.  Sprinkle with sugar to taste and cover with a thick layer of peeled and sliced apples.
      Repeat the procedure until all is used up.  Finish with a layer of breadcrumbs.  Press it all well together and dot with butter. Bake at 330 degrees; for about 30 minutes.  The apples must be well cooked. Cool the apple cake and turn it out of the form.  When the cake is cold, decorate with whipped cream.  You may also serve the cake lukewarm.
