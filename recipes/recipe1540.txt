ICED TEA


2  c. boiling hot water
2  family size or 8 small tea bags
1 1/2  c. sugar
8  c. cold water
12  tea bags
1  qt. tepid water

      Empty contents of tea bags into a 1-quart preserving jar.  Add water and stir briskly.  Screw jar lid down tight so jar will not leak when turned upside-down.  Set jar in sunny window and leave until liquid is as dark as strong coffee.  How long this will take varies on the intensity of the sun, but allow anywhere from 4 to 8 hours.  Also, turn jar several times as tea brews or whenever you are passing by.  Strain tea through a small fine sieve into a clean 1-quart jar.  Screw lid down tight and store in refrigerator.
      To make a 10 ounce glass of iced tea, pour 1/4 to 1/3 cup of tea concentrate into a glass.  Add 4 to 5 ice cubes.  Fill with cold water and stir.  Lemon wedges or lime wedges may be added.  If you like sweet tea, make a recipe of sugar syrup and store in jar with lid.  Sugar crystals do not dissolve well in cold liquids. About a teaspoon of syrup is equivalent to a teaspoon of sugar.
