MARVELOUS CHEESE STRAWS


1  lb. extra sharp cheese, grated
1 1/2  sticks real butter, melted
2  c. flour
1 1/2  tsp. salt
3/4  tsp. red pepper (to taste)

      Sift flour.  Pour melted butter over grated cheese.  Add flour, salt and pepper.  Work it together using hands until it forms a good ball.  Press through a cookie press on ungreased cookie sheets.  Cut across in 3 in. strips before cooking.  Bake 20 minutes at 325-350 degrees; until they stop sizzling.  Do not brown, but bottoms should be golden.
