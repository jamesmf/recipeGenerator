HONEY OF A CHICKEN BREAST


3  chicken breasts, skinned, split and boned
  seasoned salt and pepper
1  c. coarse bread crumbs
1/2  tsp. thyme
1  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. oregano
1/2  c. white wine
1/2  c. vegetable oil

      Rinse chicken under running cold water; drain and pat dry with paper towel.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.  Combine crumbs and herbs.  Brush all sides of chicken with oil; then roll each piece in crumb mixture until coated on all sides.  Spread honey mixture on each piece of chicken and roll into a ball.  Make a cup of foil to hold each piece of chicken.  Place in baking dish.  Pour wine over each piece of chicken.  Then generously cover top of chicken with more honey sauce, about 1 1/2 tablespoons for each piece.  Place in 375 degrees; oven and bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes or until golden brown.
Honey Sauce For Chicken:
1  c. honey
1/4  c. prepared mustard
1/4  c. prepared horseradish

      Mix all ingredients together.  The honey sauce is the secret to this recipe.  Use leftover sauce to dip fried chicken in.  We like it best like this.
