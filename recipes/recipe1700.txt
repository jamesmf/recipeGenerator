      This is the traditional cake of Israel and it is exceedingly popular.  It has no Hebrew name but is called by the European designation, torte.  This cake appears in many shades and shapes and is covered in a variety of ways.  A typical method involves cutting the cake horizontally in two and covering it with fresh strawberries (for which Israel is famous), jelly and whipped cream.
