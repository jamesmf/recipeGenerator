(Green Pea Soup)  

2  c. dried green split peas (1 lb.)
4  qt. water
4  medium-sized onions, diced or grated
1/4  c. chopped fresh celery tops
3  carrots, peeled and diced or grated
  freshly ground black pepper
2  large meaty pig's feet
1/4  lb. ham
2  tsp. salt
1  medium-sized celery root (celeriac), peeled and diced in 1/4-inch pieces
1/2  lb. precooked smoked sausage, sliced in 1/4 rounds

      Thoroughly wash the split peas.  In a large heavy pot, combine the split peas, pig's feet, ham and water.  Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming off the foam and scum as they rise to the surface.  Reduce the heat to low; partially cover the pan and simmer for 3 hours.  Add the salt, onions, celery tops, celery root and carrots and simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes.  (If the ham is salty, you may wish to reduce the salt.)
      Remove the pig's feet and ham with a slotted spoon and transfer to a cutting board.  Remove the skin, gristle, fat and bones and cut the meat into a 1/4-inch dice.  Return the diced meats to the soup and add the sliced sausage and a few grindings of black pepper.  Stirring constantly, bring the soup to a simmer over moderate heat and cook for a few minutes to heat the sausage through.  Taste for seasoning and serve from a heated tureen or in individual soup plates.  For additional body or to reduce the salt flavor, you may wish to add about 1 1/2 pounds of peeled, diced potatoes to the soup at the same time you add the other vegetables.
