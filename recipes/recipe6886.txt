CRISPY OVEN-FRIED CHICKEN


12  pieces chicken, skinned
1/4  c. low-fat oil
1/4  tsp. salt
  ground black pepper to taste
1  tsp. ginger
1  clove garlic, crushed
1  tsp. paprika
4  c. wheat-flake cereal or corn flakes, crushed

	Preheat oven to 350 degrees;. Rinse chicken and pat dry. Combine oil, salt, pepper, ginger, garlic and paprika in a small bowl. Place cereal in a pie plate or on a piece of foil. Brush each piece of chicken on both sides with oil mixture, then dip in cereal crumbs, pressing lightly to get an even coating on all sides. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake 45 to 60 minutes or until chicken is golden brown and tender. Timing will vary according to the thickness of the chicken pieces.
