APPLE DIP II


2 (8 oz.)  pkg. cream cheese, softened
3/4  c. brown sugar
2  Tbsp. vanilla
1  (18 oz.) container Marzetti's caramel apple dip
1  c. pecans or walnuts, chopped

	Mix cream cheese, brown sugar and vanilla until fluffy using an electric mixer. Spread about 1/2-inch thick onto a platter. Heat the Marzetti's caramel apple dip in the microwave for 1 minute; it must be warm to spread evenly. Next, spread caramel on top of cream cheese mixture on platter. Garnish with chopped nuts. Serve with apple wedges, celery or pretzels. Serves 8 to 10.
