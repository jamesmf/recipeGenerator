MEAT PIES

Filling:
4  Tbsp. flour
2  Tbsp. shortening
1  lb. ground pork sausage
1/2  lb. ground meat
2  large onions, chopped
6  green onions, chopped
3  Tbsp. chopped parsley
  salt and pepper to taste

 
Dough:
4  c. flour
2  eggs (at room temperature)
1/2  c. melted shortening
1/2  c. milk (at room temperature)
2  tsp. baking powder
1  tsp. salt

	For filling, make a roux with shortening and flour. Add remaining ingredients; cook until meat and seasonings are done, about 30 minutes over medium heat. Stir with fork so that meat mixture will not pack. Skim off excess fat. Allow meat to cool thoroughly before making pies.
	To make dough, sift flour, baking powder and salt. Add melted shortening. Beat eggs and add about 1/2 cup milk. Add egg mixture to flour mixture and blend.
	 Thinly roll dough on a floured board or tabletop. Cut circle of dough around a 6-inch saucer with knife. Fill with about 1 tablespoon of meat mixture. Dampen edge of pie with cold water; fold over meat and press edges together with floured fork. Prick top twice with fork. Fry in deep fat at about 375 degrees; until brown.
	 Pies freeze beautifully if enclosed in plastic bags. Do not thaw frozen pies before frying.
