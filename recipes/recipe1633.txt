SPICED MEAT ROLL
(Rulleolse)  

1  flank beef or lamb
3  to 4 thin sliced pork
2  Tbsp. salt
1  tsp. pepper
1  chopped onion
1/2  tsp. allspice

 
Brine:
2 1/2  qt. boiling water
2  c. salt
1/2  tsp. saltpeter

      Remove sinew from meat and cut it so it forms a square or rectangle.  Flatten out and sprinkle with seasoning.  Lay pork slices on flank.  Roll meat tightly so when it is cut, it will slice across the grain of meat.  Sew ends and sides.  Put in cold brine for 10 days.
      After 10 days, remove meat from brine.  Tie securely with cord and put into boiling water.  Cook slowly for 2 hours or until tender.  Remove from water and press between two flat surfaces until cold.  Serve thin slices on bread.
