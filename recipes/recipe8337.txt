FRIED CHICKEN II


  boneless, skinless chicken breast (1 per person or more)
1  tsp. poultry seasoning
  garlic powder (optional)

	Thaw and cut chicken breast into 3 strips. Pound lightly on both sides with a meat hammer or saucer. Place in a microwave dish and microwave for 3 minutes; remove and cool chicken. Place in a bag large enough to accommodate the amount of chicken you prepare. Mix flour, chicken seasoning and other optional seasoning in a bag and shake until somewhat coated. Fry in a small amount of olive oil on medium heat for 5 minutes. Turn and repeat until golden brown.
