MAKE YOUR OWN HONEY BAKED HAM


1  (7 lb.) smoked pork picnic shoulder
2  c. sugar
1  c. packed brown sugar
1 (6 oz.)  can frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed
1  tsp. crushed cloves

      Make crosswise slits, 1/2 inch apart, halfway through ham to where knife touches bone.  Place ham in a large zip lock bag. Stir together sugars, orange juice and cloves.  Pour mixture over ham in bag.  Close bag and soak at least 2 days in the refrigerator.  Place ham in roasting pan, lined with enough foil to cover ham.  Wrap tightly with foil.  Bake at 200 degrees until heated through.
