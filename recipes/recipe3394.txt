CHEESE CHRISTMAS TREE

Tree:
2  (8 oz.) pkgs. cream cheese, softened
1/2  c. chopped green onions
1/2  c. pimento olives chopped
1/4  tsp. garlic powder
  4-5 slices dried beef (optional)

      Mix first 5 ingredients together; press out on tray and form "tree."
"Decorations":
  Green bell pepper for star
  Pimentos for garland
  Chopped parsley and/or green onions

      Star at top -- cut out of a green bell pepper.  Garland -- pimentos zig-zagged from one side to the other.  Then sprinkle chopped parsley and/or green onions.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.  The longer it sets, the better it is.  (Put toothpicks in it to keep cover off cheese.)
