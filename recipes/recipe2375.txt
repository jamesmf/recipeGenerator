RHUBARB COBBLER WITH OAT DUMPLINGS

Cobbler:
3/4  c. sugar
1  c. water
1  lb. fresh or frozen rhubarb, sliced into 1-inch pieces (4 c.)
2  Tbsp. cornstarch
1/2  c. orange juice

      In a small saucepan, stir together the 3/4 cup sugar and the cornstarch.  Stir in water and orange juice.  Cook and stir over medium-high heat until the mixture is thickened and bubbly.  Add the fresh or frozen rhubarb pieces; cook and stir until the mixture returns to boiling.  Remove from the heat.  Cover the mixture to keep warm.
Dumplings:
1/2  c. all-purpose flour
1/4  c. quick-cooking rolled oats
1/4  c. whole-wheat flour
1 1/2  tsp. baking powder
1/2  c. skim milk
2  Tbsp. cooking oil
1  Tbsp. sugar
1/4  tsp. ground cinnamon

      For dumplings, in a medium mixing bowl, stir together the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, rolled oats and baking powder.  In a 1-cup glass measure, stir together the skim milk and oil.  Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture; stir just until flour mixture is moistened.  Do not overmix.  Transfer the warm rhubarb mixture to a 2-quart casserole.  Immediately spoon the dumpling batter into 8 mounds on top of the warm rhubarb mixture. In a small dish, stir together the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over the top of the dumplings.  Bake, uncovered, in a 425 degrees; oven about 20 minutes.  Serve warm.
