MOTHER'S QUICK AND EASY CHOCOLATE SAUCE


1  sq. unsweetened chocolate
1  c. sugar
1  c. milk
  a "gob" of butter (probably about 1 Tbsp.)
  a pinch of salt
1  tsp. vanilla

      Mix these (except vanilla) together and, while stirring, melt over a slow heat.  If it boils, the sauce will form a shell on the cold ice cream and that's not all together bad.  Take off the heat when melted and stir in vanilla.  Spoon over ice cream and enjoy!
