DELI DOGS


1/2  c. tomato, chopped
1/4  c. onion, chopped
1/4  c. pepperoncini peppers, drained, chopped
1 2 1/4  oz. can sliced, pitted black olives, drained

6  hot dog buns, split
  mustard

      Mix tomato, onion, peppers and olives until well blended. Heat franks as directed on package.  Serve in buns topped with tomato mixture and mustard.  Makes 6 servings.
