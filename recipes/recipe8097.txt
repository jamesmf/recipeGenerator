CHICKEN POT PIE


1  stick oleo or butter
2  cans of white chicken (I use the really large ones)
2  cans of Veg-All (drained)
2  cans cream of chicken soup
2  cans of chicken broth
2  c. Bisquick
2  c. milk

	Melt butter in a deep 13 x 9-inch dish.  Put chicken on top of butter.	Pour Veg-All on top of chicken.  Mix cream of chicken soup and chicken broth together in a separate bowl and then pour over Veg-All.  In another separate bowl, mix Bisquick and milk. Pour this mixture on top.  Bake at 350 degrees; for about 45 minutes or until crust is golden brown.  Makes a very large casserole.  It's the best chicken pot pie ever and so easy.
