SAM'S CHILI
(A Vegetarian Weight Watchers Recipe)  

1  can chili hot beans
1  can Mexican style stewed tomatoes
1  can black beans, drained and rinsed
2  Tbsp. chili powder
2  tsp. cumin
1/2  c. frozen corn
1/2  c. salsa
1/2  firmly chopped bell pepper (optional)

      I always double this recipe.  Simmer easy and very satisfying.
