BANANA-NUT CAKE


2 1/3  c. all-purpose flour
1 2/3  c. sugar
1 1/4  c. mashed bananas
2/3  c. shortening
3  eggs
1 1/4  tsp. baking soda
1  tsp. salt
2/3  c. finely chopped nuts
2/3  c. buttermilk
1 1/4  tsp. baking powder

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Grease and flour oblong pan, 13 x 9 x 2-inches, or two 9-inch or three 8-inch round layer pans.  Beat all ingredients in a large mixing bowl at low speed for 30 seconds, scraping the bowl constantly.  Beat on high speed for 3 minutes, scraping the bowl occasionally.  Pour into pans.  Bake until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean (about 45 to 50 minutes for oblong, 35 to 40 minutes for layers).  Cool.  Frost with Vanilla Butter Frosting, if desired.
Vanilla Butter Frosting:
3  c. powdered sugar
1 1/2  tsp. vanilla
1/3  c. butter
2  Tbsp. milk (roughly)

      Mix the powdered sugar and butter.  Stir in the vanilla and milk; beat until frosting is smooth and of spreading consistency.
