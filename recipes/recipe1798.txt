SALMON CAKES


2  lb. boned fillet of salmon
3  eggs
1/2  c. heavy cream
1  scallion
1  sprig of parsley
1  sprig of tarragon
1  soup spoon of capers
2  sun-dried tomatoes
  salt and pepper
1  oz. olive oil
4  oz. balsamic vinaigrette
6  c. of fancy salad mix

      Chop coarse:  scallion, parsley, tarragon, capers and sun-dried tomatoes.  Put salmon fillets through meat grinder or food processor on slow speed, not too fine.  Blend eggs and heavy cream slowly into coarse salmon meat, one egg at a time, with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon.  Add chopped ingredients.  Mix well.  Add juice of lemon, salt and pepper to your own taste.
      Form eight salmon cakes, about half-inch thick; refrigerate for two hours.  Heat olive oil in pan.  Saut√© salmon cakes for two minutes on each side.  Remove from pan, keep hot.  Drain olive oil from pan.  Add balsamic vinaigrette to pan.  Heat.  Add fancy mixed salad to hot vinaigrette.  Toss salad until starting to wilt (about one minute).  Arrange salad on plates.  Top with salmon cakes. Spoon remaining vinaigrette over salmon and serve.
