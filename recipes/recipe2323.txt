CANNED GREEN TOMATOES


  sliced green tomatoes (not peeled)
  large pot of boiling water
  citric acid

      Slice green tomatoes and set aside.  Bring a large pot of water to boiling.  Sterilize canning jars and lids.  I use a wire basket for putting tomatoes in the boiling water and put enough to fill one jar at a time.  Let tomatoes stay in boiling water ONLY long enough for them to change color, no more than 3 to 5 minutes.  Put into hot jar being sure to layer enough to fill jar.  Pour hot liquid from cooking pot over tomatoes and put a knife tip of citric acid in each jar.  Seal.  You may want to keep an extra small pot of boiling water in case the large pot gets too low on water.
Batter:
  salt and pepper
1/2  c. self-rising flour
2  c. cornmeal
  hot oil

      Drain green tomatoes.  Mix salt, pepper, flour and cornmeal. Batter tomatoes and fry in hot oil.  These are really good in cold weather.
