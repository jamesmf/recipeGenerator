HAMBURGER AND BEAN POT


1 1/2  lb. lean hamburger
1  medium onion
2 large  cans pork and beans
2  Tbsp. black molasses
2  Tbsp. ketchup
  dash of Worcestershire sauce

      Crumble and fry hamburger and onion in skillet until hamburger is slightly brown and onion is clear; drain off all fat.  Place pork and beans in large deep baking dish.  Mix in molasses, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce.  If pork and beans are too dry, may need to add 1/4 cup water.  Mix 3/4 of hamburger and onion with pork and bean mixture.  Place remainder of hamburger on top.  Bake in microwave for 15 minutes on High, covered with glass lid or double plastic wrap.  Serve hot.  This goes well on cold winter evenings with a bowl of cole slaw and rolls.
