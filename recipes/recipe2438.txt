HOW TO HAVE A TAFFY PULL

Taffy:
1 1/2  c. molasses
3/4  c. sugar
2  Tbsp. butter
2  tsp. vinegar (cider)
1  tsp. lemon extract

      Combine molasses, sugar, butter and vinegar.  Bring to a boil slowly, stirring constantly.  Boil about 25 to 30 minutes, stirring constantly toward end of cooking, to 260 degrees; (until a small quantity dropped in cold water forms hard ball).  Remove from heat; add lemon extract.
To Pull Taffy:

      Pour the cooked candy on aluminum foil or an oiled platter. Let it cool until you can dent it with your finger.  Grease hands with butter.  Separate taffy into lumps for each person, then have them pull and stretch it, then squeeze it back into a lump, continuing pulling and squeezing until it turns from brown to a golden yellow color.  Roll it into long strips and cut into 1-inch pieces with scissors.  Makes about 1 pound.
