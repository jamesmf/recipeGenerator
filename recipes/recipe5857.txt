TORTILLA SOUP


1  lb. chicken
3  celery stalks
2  carrots
32  oz. chicken broth
1  bag corn chips
2  avocados
  cooking oil
2  onions
4  cloves garlic
1  fresh jalapeno
4  tsp. chili powder
1/4  lb. Colby Jack cheese
6  oz. sour cream
1 (15 oz.)  can whole tomatoes

      Chop celery, carrot, onion, garlic and jalapeno. In a skillet, saut in 1 teaspoon of cooking oil until seared and almost tender. Cut up chicken and add to the mixture. Simmer until chicken is cooked through but not very brown. Place mixture into a large pot. Add chicken broth, tomatoes with the juice, chili powder and salt and pepper to taste.
      Five minutes before serving, add grated cheese and the peeled and diced avocados to the soup. Let it simmer until the cheese melts.
       To serve, ladle into large bowls that will have room for a garnish of extra cheese, tomato, avocado and of course, a blob of sour cream.
