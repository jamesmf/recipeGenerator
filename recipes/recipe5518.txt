BEEF STEW


1  1/2 lbs. boneless beef
3  Tbsp. shortening
1 3/4  tsp. salt
  a few dashes of pepper
1  onion, the size of a large egg
4  to 5 carrots
4  or 5 potatoes
3  Tbsp. flour
1/3  c. water and more when needed

      Cut meat up into small pieces.  Heat shortening in a large pot on the stove.  Add meat, turning often till brown.  Add sliced onion to the last 5 minutes of browning.  When brown, sprinkle with 1 tsp. salt and pepper.  Add water, cover and heat to boiling. Reduce heat and simmer until meat is done, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Add more water if needed.
      Slice carrots and potatoes and add to meat.  Pour in enough water to cover vegetables.  Add rest of salt and cook until vegetables are done.  Then stir together flour and 1/3 cup water to make a thickening.  Pour into stew and cook about 2 to 3 minutes.
