BLACKENED FISH


4  fresh or frozen catfish, cod, pollock, pompano or haddock fillets (1 lb.)
1/4  tsp. onion powder
1/2  tsp. garlic salt
1/2  tsp. ground red pepper
1/2  tsp. dried basil, crushed
1/4  tsp. ground white pepper
1/4  tsp. dried thyme, crushed
1/4  tsp. black pepper
1/8  tsp. ground sage
1/4  c. margarine or butter, melted

      Thaw fish if frozen.  In a small mixing bowl combine onion powder, garlic salt, red pepper, basil, white pepper, thyme, black pepper and sage.  Brush both sides of fish with melted margarine; coat with seasoning.  If using a charcoal grill, remove grill rack and place an unoiled 12-inch cast-iron skillet directly on hot coals.  If using a gas grill, turn to high and place skillet on the grill rack.  Preheat the skillet 5 minutes or until a drop of water sizzles.  Add coated fillets to skillet.  Carefully drizzle about 2 teaspoons of melted margarine over the fish.  Grill fish 2 1/2 to 3 minutes or until blackened.  Turn fish and drizzle with 2 teaspoons of melted margarine.  Grill 2 1/2 to 3 minutes more.  Transfer to serving plates.  Drizzle with any remaining melted margarine. Makes 4 servings.
