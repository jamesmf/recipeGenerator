BUTTERED BELGIAN ENDIVES


8  Belgian endive heads
2  Tbsp. butter
  salt and pepper to taste
2  Tbsp. water
1/2  tsp. lemon juice
1  Tbsp. parsley leaves, finely chopped

      Rub the butter over the bottom of a shallow flameproof casserole or skillet.  Trim off the bottoms and any damaged outer leaves of the endive and cut the heads into diagonal slices about 1-inch thick.  Put them in the pan with salt and pepper to taste, lemon juice and water.  Press a piece of buttered foil on top of the endive and cover with a lid.  Cook over low heat for 7 to 8 minutes or until the endive is tender.  Shake the pan occasionally. Sprinkle with the chopped parsley and serve.
