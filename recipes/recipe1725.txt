LAHAM BE-AJEEN
(Meat on Pasta)  

1  lb. ready made bread dough (frozen)
3  Tbsp. olive oil
2  lb. ground lamb or beef
1  medium onion, chopped
1  green bell pepper, chopped
1  tomato, coarsely chopped
1 (8 oz.)  can tomato sauce
3  Tbsp. Tahini
1  tsp. Middle Eastern spice
1  tsp. salt

      Thaw bread dough.  Let rise for about one hour (follow package instructions).  Form and cut dough into disks of about 2-inches in diameter and 2-inches thick.  Grease your fingertips with the olive oil.  Press each dough piece into 1/2-inch thick disks.  Place dough disks in a lightly greased baking sheet about 2-inches apart. Set aside in a warm place.  Mix lamb (or beef), onion, green pepper, tomato, tomato sauce, Tahini, spice and salt.  Spread one to two tablespoons of the meat mixture on the dough disks.  Bake in 350 degrees; oven for 15 minutes or until dough is golden brown.  Let cool for few minutes then transfer to a platter.  Serve warm or cold.
