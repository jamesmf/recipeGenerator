OUR FAVORITE SALAD


1  head iceberg lettuce
1/2  head leaf lettuce
2  large Granny Smith apples, diced
1/2  lb. red seedless grapes, loose
3/4  c. cheddar cheese, shredded
1/2  c. walnuts, coarsely chopped
1/2  c. banana chops, coarsely chopped
1/4  c. ruby raisins (dried cranberries)
1/2  c. Sunflower seeds, roasted and salted
1/4  c. sliced red onion
  Honey Poppyseed Dressing

      Wash all produce and drain well. A salad spinner works excellent. Rip both lettuce varieties into bite size pieces. Add onion and toss. Combine walnuts, banana chops, ruby raisins, and sunflower seeds.
      Serve individual salads or make one large bowl.  Just before serving on top of greens generously sprinkle blend of walnuts, banana chops, raisins and sunflower seed.  Add diced apples, grapes and cheddar cheese.  Serve with Poppyseed Dressing.  Serves 6.
