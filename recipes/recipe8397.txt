FAYE'S CROCK-POT CHICKEN AND DRESSING


1  pkg. boneless chicken breast (about 2 1/2 lb.)
2  cans cream of chicken soup
2  Tbsp. sage or poultry seasoning
1  skillet cornbread
4  to 6 homemade biscuits
1  c. finely chopped celery
1  c. finely chopped onions
4  boiled eggs, finely chopped
1  stick margarine

      Boil chicken breast until done, reserving the liquid.  Shred chicken after it has cooled.  Crumble and mix cornbread and biscuits together.  To the cornbread mixture add the following and mix well:  1 can of soup, celery, onion, boiled eggs, sage or poultry seasoning, salt and pepper to taste and enough of the reserved liquid to make a very moist consistency but not runny. Add 1/2 of the second can of soup to the crock-pot.  On top of that, add 1/2 of the cornbread mixture.  Add 1/2 of the shredded chicken to the top of the cornbread mixture.  Then add the remaining half of the cornbread mixture.  Add remaining chicken. Cover chicken with remaining half of the soup.  Set crock-pot on low and cook for 3 to 3 1/2 hours.  Serve hot.  Makes about 8 to 10 servings.
