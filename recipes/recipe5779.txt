PARTY SALAD


1 (8 oz.)  can crushed pineapple
1  (8 oz.) cream cheese
1  c. chopped pecans
1/8  tsp. salt
1 (6 oz.)  pkg. lemon jello
3/4  c. finely cut celery
2  c. whipped topping
1  (4 oz.) chopped pimentos

      Add enough boiling water to pineapple juice to make 2 cups and dissolve jello in it. Mix salt, pimento and cream cheese together and add to hot jello gradually. May soften cheese in microwave.
