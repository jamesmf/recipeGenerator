PARTY FRUIT PUNCH
(A Superb Wedding Punch!)  


4 large  cans pineapple juice, unsweetened
1 large  can grapefruit juice, unsweetened
1 large  can frozen lemonade, diluted
1 large  can frozen orange juice, diluted
2 small  cans frozen limeade, diluted
4 to 5  drops peppermint extract
2 large  cans crushed pineapple, undrained
2  Tbsp. grenadine syrup, ginger ale or Sprite
4  c. sugar

      Mix all ingredients together (except ginger ale or Sprite) in a very large container.  Stir until sugar is dissolved.  (Sugar may be omitted if you feel that some you will be serving are diabetic!) Pour into 5 to 6 five quart plastic buckets.  (Ice cream buckets are excellent for freezing.)  Put in freezer.  Serves 150 to 200.
      When ready to serve, add 2 bottles ginger ale (or 2 liters Sprite) to the bucket of punch.  Take out of freezer 3 to 4 hours before serving.  This is a bright yellow punch; can be poured over 1 quart pineapple sherbet for a lighter, frothy look.  Will be a slush.
      For Green Punch:  Add 1 quart lime sherbet and a few drops green food coloring.  Add slowly and stir to keep it light in color.
      For Red Punch:  Add 2 (10 ounce) packages frozen, sliced strawberries and few drops red food coloring.
