CHICKEN-MARINATED BAKED


1/2  c. Italian salad dressing
1/2  c. soy sauce
6  bone-in chicken breast halves
1/8  tsp. onion salt
1/8  tsp. garlic salt
  kale and spiced apple rings (optional)

      In a measuring cup, combine salad dressing and soy sauce. Pour 3/4 cup into a large, resealable plastic bag. Add chicken. Seal the bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight, turning several times. Refrigerate remaining marinade for basting.
      Drain chicken, discarding marinade. Place chicken, skin side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Sprinkle with onion salt and garlic salt. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees; for 45 to 60 minutes or until juices run clear and a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees;, brushing occasionally with reserved marinade. Garnish platter with kale and apple rings, if desired. Yield: 6 servings.
