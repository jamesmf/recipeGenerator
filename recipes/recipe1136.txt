(From Joslin Diabetic Clinic)  

1/2  c. chopped-cooked chicken
1/4  c. bean sprouts
3  water chestnuts, thinly sliced
1  tsp. soy sauce
4  eggs
1/4  c. water
2  Tbsp. chopped green pepper
1/2  tsp. minced onion
1/2  tsp. salt
  dash of pepper
1  Tbsp. butter or margarine

      Combine chicken, bean sprouts, water chestnuts and soy sauce and mix well.  Set aside.  Mix eggs, water, green pepper, onion, salt and pepper with a fork.  Heat butter or margarine in a 10-inch skillet.  Pour in egg mixture.  With spatula, draw cooked portions of egg toward center so that uncooked portions flow to bottom. Cook until bottom is set and lightly browned and top is creamy. Arrange chicken mixture on half of omelet.  With spatula, fold other half over and turn out on serving platter.  Yields 2 servings.  Each serving equals 3 ounces of meat and 1 vegetable.
