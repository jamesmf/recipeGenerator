4  pork chops
4  medium potatoes
2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. pepper
1  Tbsp. butter
1  cup top milk or canned milk

      Brown 4 pork chops. Peel and slice 4 medium potatoes thin. Mix 2 Tbsp. flour, 2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper.  Pour over the potatoes.  Dot with a Tbsp. of butter.  Pour the 1 cup milk (cream or canned milk) over the potatoes.  Lay the pork chops on top. Bake covered at 400 degrees for 45 minutes.  Remove the lid and bake an additional 15 minutes or until the potatoes are brown.
      If canned milk is used mix down with half water.  Can use just regular milk.  Cook about 1/2 hour longer at least if extra is made.
