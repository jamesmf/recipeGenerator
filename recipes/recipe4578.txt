JELLIED CRANBERRY CHEESE SALAD


1/2  c. red cinnamon candies
2 2/3  c. boiling water
2 (3 oz.)  pkg. lemon flavored gelatin
1/3  c. lemon juice
2 (1 lb.)  cans jellied or whole cranberries
2 (3 oz.)  pkg. cream cheese
1/4  c. heavy cream
1/4  c. mayonnaise
1  tsp. grated lemon peel

      Dissolve candies in the boiling water; add lemon gelatin and lemon juice.  Stir to dissolve gelatin and cool to room temperature.  Add cranberry sauce (if jellied cranberry sauce is used, beat with a rotary beater).  Pour 1/2 of the cranberry gelatin mixture into a 9-inch square pan.  Set aside remaining cranberry gelatin mixture at room temperature; cover.  Chill mixture in the pan until firm, about 2 1/2 hours.
       Combine cream cheese, heavy cream, and mayonnaise in a bowl; beat until smooth. Stir in lemon peel; mix thoroughly. Spread cream cheese mixture evenly over the chilled cranberry gelatin mixture. Pour reserved cranberry gelatin mixture over cream cheese layer.
       Chill 8 hours or overnight, until firm. Cut into squares and arrange on crisp greens. Makes 8-10 servings.
