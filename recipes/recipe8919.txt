ONE-STEP LASAGNA


4  c. grated Mozzarella cheese
2  c. Ricotta cheese (may be lite)
1  egg
1  pkg. frozen spinach, defrosted and drained
28  oz. spaghetti sauce
1/2  pkg. uncooked lasagna noodles
2/3  c. water

      Set aside 1 cup Mozzarella for topping. Combine Ricotta, remaining 3 cups Mozzarella and egg in a bowl. Add spinach. Spread 3/4 cup spaghetti sauce over bottom of 9 x 13 baking dish. Place 5 dry noodles over this in a single layer, 4 lengthways and 1 crossways. The crossways one will be too long, so break off the end to make it fit. Place half of cheese mixture on top of the noodles. Pour another 3/4 cup of sauce over cheese mixture; lay remaining noodles on top of sauce. Top with remaining cheese mixture. Pour remaining sauce over all and finally, top with the 1 cup reserved Mozzarella. The uncooked dish can sit all day or overnight in the refrigerator.
       Just before baking, heat oven to 350 degrees;. Pour water around the edge of the casserole; cover tightly with tinfoil and bake for 1 hour. At the end of this time, remove the lasagna from the oven and (very important!) let it sit, covered, for 20 minutes before cutting into serving pieces.
