AUNT HAZEL'S SUGARED PECANS


4  c. pecan halves
1  large egg white
1  tsp. water
1/2  c. sugar
1  tsp. vanilla
1/4  tsp. salt

	Beat egg white and water until soft peaks are formed. Add pecans and mix well. Combine sugar, vanilla and salt in a separate bowl. Add pecans to mixture and mix well. Spread in an ungreased cookie sheet and bake approximately 1 hour at 250 degrees;. Stir the pecans half way through the cooking time and begin checking for doneness at 50 minutes by tasting. Cooking too long will cause a scorched taste.
	 For a less sweet taste, use more pecans with the same amount of mixture.
