CHICKEN FLAUTAS WITH SALSA


1/2  c. chopped onion
1  clove garlic
2  Tbsp. oil
1 1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
1/2  c. chicken broth
2 1/4  c. cooked chicken
1 (4 oz.)  can green chilies
  oil for frying
12  corn tortillas
  Salsa (recipe follows)
1  Tbsp. cornstarch

      Sauté onion and garlic until tender.  Stir in cornstarch, salt and pepper.  Mix well.  Stir in broth, chicken and chilies.  Cook, stirring constantly, until very thick and bubbly.  Dip tortillas in 1/4-inch hot oil to soften.  Spoon a heaping tablespoon of filling in each tortilla and roll up.  Sauté flautas, a few at a time, in hot oil, turning often until crisp, about 2 minutes.  Keep warm. Serve with Salsa.  Garnish with lettuce.
Salsa:
2  tomatoes, chopped
1  medium onion, chopped
1/2  medium seeded green pepper, chopped
1/4  c. chopped parsley
1 minced  clove garlic
1/2  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. pepper
1/8  tsp. ground cumin

      Combine ingredients.  Refrigerate 1 hour.
