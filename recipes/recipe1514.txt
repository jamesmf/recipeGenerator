GRILL BAKED APPLE-GINGER CAKES


1 (14 oz.)  pkg. gingerbread mix
1 (16 oz.)  can applesauce

      You will also need 8 to 10-inch squares foil.
      Follow package directions for making gingerbread mix.  Shape foil by placing a glass in center of square, bringing edges up around foil; remove glass and brush centers with shortening. Divide applesauce among cups and spoon gingerbread mix over the applesauce.  Crimp edges of foil, leaving space for batter to rise. Place around edges of grill and allow to cook for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from grill; open foil and allow to cool slightly.  Serve as is or with whipped cream or ice cream.
