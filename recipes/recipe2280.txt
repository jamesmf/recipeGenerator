      Cook meat until very tender in water to which salt has been added.  While meat is cooking, make sauce.  Melt shortening and add onions; cook until tender, but not browned.  Add remaining ingredients and cook over low heat for 20 minutes.  Add shredded meat and liquid to the sauce and mix well.  Cover and cook very slowly for 30 minutes.  If mixture becomes too thick, add a little water.  Serve on hamburger buns.
