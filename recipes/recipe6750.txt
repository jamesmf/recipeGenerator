ITALIAN PORK CHOPS AND MANICOTTI


4  center cut pork chops
2  cans tomato paste
1  bulb garlic, peeled and separated
2  tsp. parsley
2  tsp. basil
1  tsp. salt
1  tsp. pepper
1  box jumbo manicotti shells
1  large container small curd cottage cheese
1  egg
3  oz. cream cheese, softened
1  pkg. shredded Mozzarella (optional)

      Brown pork chops in oil.  Mix together in a medium bowl 2 cans tomato paste and 4 cans of water.  Add 1 teaspoon parsley, 1 teaspoon basil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and the separated and peeled garlic cloves.  Place the browned pork chops in a Dutch oven and pour the tomato sauce over the pork chops. Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and cover.  Simmer for 1 hour.  In a medium bowl, mix together cottage cheese, egg, softened cream cheese, 1 teaspoon parsley, 1 teaspoon basil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Refrigerate until pork chops are finished simmering.  Cook manicotti shells according to directions on the box.  Rinse in cold water and drain.  Pour onto waxed paper.  In a 9 x 13 casserole dish, spoon a small amount of tomato sauce (enough to cover the bottom).  Fill the manicotti shells with the cottage cheese mixture and place in the casserole dish. Pour almost all of the remaining sauce over the manicotti (save some for the pork chops).  Cover with foil.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 30 minutes.  Serve along with pork chops.
       Optional:  Before covering with foil, cover the manicotti with shredded Mozzarella cheese.  (May have to bake longer.)
