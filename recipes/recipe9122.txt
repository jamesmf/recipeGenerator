BAKED HAM


1  (8 to 10 lb.) bone-in smoked ham
1 (20 0z.)  can sliced pineapple in syrup
1/2  tsp. ground allspice
  whole cloves
1  tsp. dry mustard
  maraschino cherries

      Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Cut rind from ham. Place ham on back in open roasting pan, fat side up. Roast in oven 3 hours. Drain pineapple, reserve syrup. In small saucepan, combine syrup, mustard and allspice. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Remove ham from oven. Keep oven hot. Stud ham with cloves. Brush with glaze. Using wooden toothpicks, secure pineapple slices and cherries to ham and brush with glaze. Return ham  to oven. Roast 30 minutes longer, (about 25 minutes per lb. total cooking time). Brush with glaze 15 minutes before done. Let ham stand 20 minutes before slicing.
