CHOCOLATE COVERED CHERRIES


50  maraschino cherries
1/3  c. margarine
1/3  c. light Karo syrup
1  lb. powdered sugar
1  Tbsp. paraffin wax
1  c. semi-sweet chocolate chips
2  sq. Baker's unsweetened chocolate

      Drain maraschino cherries.  Make fondant by mixing thoroughly the softened margarine, Karo and powdered sugar.  Cover each cherry with about 1 teaspoon fondant.  Put on cookie sheet.  Cool fondant balls in freezer, but do not let the cherries freeze.  In double boiler, melt together the paraffin, chocolate chips and Baker's chocolate.  Keep warm.  Remove cherries from freezer and dip into chocolate sauce.  Put on wax paper to harden.
