CHICKEN PARMESAN


3  (2 1/2 to 3 lb.) chickens, cut up for frying or boneless chicken breasts
4 1/2  c. fresh bread crumbs
1 1/4  c. grated Parmesan cheese
1  Tbsp. salt
1/3  c. fresh parsley, chopped
1 1/2  c. butter or margarine
1  clove garlic, crushed
1  Tbsp. Dijon mustard
1 1/2  tsp. Worcestershire sauce

	Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Wash chickens and pat dry.
	 Prepare bread crumbs in blender using day-old firm-type white bread. Add cheese, salt and parsley to the crumbs and mix well.
	 Melt butter and add garlic, mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Stir well and cool enough to dip chicken in it.
	 Coat chicken with butter mixture, then roll in crumb mixture. Place chicken in shallow baking pans. Pour remaining butter mixture over chicken and place in oven. Bake 1 to 1 1/2 hours until golden and tender.
