ORIENTAL CHICKEN SALAD


1  head cabbage, shredded
3 to 4  c. chicken, cooked and shredded
4  green onions, thinly sliced
1  pkg. Ramen noodles

 
Dressing:
1/3  c. oil
1/4  c. rice vinegar
2  Tbsp. sugar
1  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. pepper

      Combine salad ingredients in a large bowl. Prepare dressing. Sprinkle until the sugar dissolves. Do not put dressing onto salad until just before serving. This way the noodles and nuts will stay crisp.
