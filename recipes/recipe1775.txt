PICKLED HERRING


1  tin of desalted herring fillets (4 fillets)
2  lemons
2/3  c. sugar
2/3  c. water
1  tsp. whole allspice
1  tsp. whole white peppercorns
2  bay leaves
1  onion
1  leek
1 large  bunch of dill or packet frozen dill (6 1/2 Tbsp.)

      Squeeze the lemons.  Make a marinade of lemon juice, water, sugar and seasonings.  Simmer the marinade (it must not boil).  Let it cool.  Drain the herring fillets well.  Cut them into pieces and chop the onion and leek.  Put the herring and the chopped onion, leek and dill into a glass jar in layers.
      Strain the marinade over the herring.  Leave overnight before serving.
