PASTA SALAD


1  lb. pasta (your choice)
1  c. olive oil
1  Tbsp. salt
1  Tbsp. pepper
1  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
1  Tbsp. hot sauce
1/2  c. celery, chopped
1/2  c. onion, chopped
1  Tbsp. garlic powder
1/2  c. parsley, chopped
1/2  lb. hard salami, cut in pieces
1/2  lb. Mozzarella cheese, shredded

	Prepare pasta according to package directions. Drain. Rinse with cold water to prevent pasta from sticking together.  Drain well and set aside to cool.
	In a small bowl, mix together the oil, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce.
	 In a large bowl, combine the pasta with the remaining ingredients and toss gently to combine.  Pour the sauce over the pasta mixture and blend well. Refrigerate overnight or for several hours before serving.
