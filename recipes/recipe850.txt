CHICKEN PARMIGIANA


4  whole large chicken breasts, boned and skinned, each cut in half
1 1/2  c. dried bread crumbs
  olive oil or salad oil
1 (18 oz.)  pkg. Mozzarella cheese
1 (15 to 15 1/2 oz.)  jar spaghetti sauce
  Parmesan cheese

      With meat mallet or dull edge of French knife, pound each chicken breast half to 1/4-inch thickness.  Place bread crumbs in pie plate.  Moisten chicken pieces with water, then dip into bread crumbs to coat evenly.  In a 12-inch skillet, over medium-high heat, add 3 tablespoons hot oil.  Cook chicken a few pieces at a time until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes.  Add more oil if necessary.  Slice Mozzarella cheese lengthwise into 8 slices.  Alternate chicken and cheese, overlapping slightly in baking dish.  Spoon spaghetti sauce over chicken.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 30 minutes.
