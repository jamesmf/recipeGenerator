SAILOR'S STEW

1  lb. stewing beef
2  lb. potatoes
2  large onions
3  to 4 bay leaves
12  to 15 peppercorns
  salt
  butter for frying

      Cut the beef into 3/4-inch squares.  Blanch and rinse in cold water.  Chop the onions finely.  Peel and cut up the potatoes. Brown 2 tablespoons butter in a thick bottomed saucepan.  Turn the meat in the butter until just colored.  Add the onions and simmer until transparent.  Add the potatoes, bay leaves and peppercorns and cover with water.  Simmer gently until all the potatoes have mashed up.
      Traditionally about 7 ounces chopped ham may be added just before serving.
      Season with salt and serve with a lump of butter, finely chopped parsley and Worcestershire sauce.
