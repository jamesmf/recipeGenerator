STEAK BURRITO


1 1/4  lb. chuck steak
1/4  lb. diced onion (optional)
1  large diced tomato
2  Tbsp. cooking oil
12  flour tortillas (10 or 12-inches)
1/2  lb. potatoes
1/2  bell pepper
8  oz. salsa
1  garlic clove

      In 4-inch deep, 10-inch diameter pan, heat oil at medium flame until it begins to smoke.  Quickly add garlic, onion and diced bell pepper.  Stir-fry for 3 minutes.  Quickly add diced potatoes and stir-fry another 3 minutes.  Add meat and stir constantly until meat browns, then cover pan.  Five minutes later, add salsa and equal amount of water; cover and simmer on low flame about 25 minutes (until meat is cooked).  Heat each flour tortilla on dry griddle 10 seconds per side.
