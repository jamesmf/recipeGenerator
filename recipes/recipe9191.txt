CREOLE MEAT LOAF


2  lb. ground beef
1  c. spanish rice (I use Van Camps 15 oz. can)
2  eggs
  salt and pepper
1/2  tsp. Texas Pete sauce
3  to 4 American cheese slices
1  c. ketchup
2  Tbsp. sugar
1/2  c. water
2  Tbsp. vinegar
  touch of worcestershire

      Combine beef, rice, eggs, salt, pepper and Texas Pete.  Place 1/2 of the meat mixture in a baking dish; place cheese slices on top.  Put the rest of the meat mixture over the cheese slices. Mix the ketchup, sugar, water, vinegar and worcestershire; put this sauce mixture on top.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 1 hour and 15 minutes.
