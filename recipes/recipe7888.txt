LAMB AND POTATO KORMA


2  lbs. lamb
2  medium onion, finely grated
1/4  cup oil
1-1/2  tsp. ginger/garlic paste
1 heaping  tsp. cayenne pepper
1/4  tsp. turmeric
1  tsp. salt
1  cup yogurt
2  cups water
6  cardamom pods
4  cloves
1  cinnamon stick
1  tsp. shah zeera (black cumin)
1/4  cup cilantro
  6-8 curry leaves
  3-4 green chilies, slitted
4  medium potatoes, quartered

      Wash and remove excess fat from meat, set aside.  In a pressure cooker or pot add oil and warm over medium-high heat. Add cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and zeera.  When it sputters, add the meat, onion, ginger/garlic, cayenne, salt, and turmeric. Brown the meat.  Cover and cook for 15 minutes in pressure cooker or 1 hour in a regular pot.  The meat should not be fully done at this point.
      Uncover the pot, add the yogurt, water and potatoes. Cover and cook again until the meat and potatoes are fully cooked. Now add cilantro, curry leaves and green chilies and cook on low heat for 5 minutes until the oil separates.
