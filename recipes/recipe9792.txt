MEXICAN SALSA CASSEROLE

Corn Bread Base:
1  cup all purpose flour
1  cup yellow corn meal
1/3  cup vegetable oil
  salt to taste
1/2  cup sugar
1/4  cup skim milk
1  egg beaten

 
Topping:
1  lb. bacon, fried and pieced
16  oz. of commercial or home canned salsa
1  container fresh mushrooms, sliced and fried
1  large onion diced and fried
1 8  oz. jar of roasted sweet red peppers - diced

      For Cornbread:  Mix ingredients by hand and spread in one large or two medium sized baking dishes.  Bake for 20 minutes or 25 minutes until bread is golden and a toothpick can be inserted and withdrawn without residue.  Cool.
      Topping:  Spread top of cooled cornbread with salsa.  Sprinkle fried onion, mushrooms, and diced red peppers on top and cover with grated cheese.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until cheese begins to bubble.  Sprinkle mushrooms on top and serve.
      Options:  Have on hand sour cream, additional salsa and more grated cheese, hot peppers, diced olives, and shredded lettuce. This is very good with all of the extras but it can be very successful with a selected few.
