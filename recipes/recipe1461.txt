GRILLED STUFFED FRANKS


1 (8 oz.)  can tomato sauce
1  Tbsp. sugar
2  Tbsp. spicy brown mustard
1/2  tsp. garlic powder
8  frankfurters
6  small green onions, chopped
8  slices bacon
8  hot dog buns

      Combine tomato sauce, sugar, mustard and garlic powder.  Stir well.  Slice frankfurters lengthwise to make a pocket.  Brush inside each pocket with sauce; sprinkle with onion.  Wrap each frankfurter with bacon, securing with a toothpick (wooden).  Cook frankfurters over hot coals 10 to 15 minutes or until bacon is crisp, turning often and basting with remaining sauce.  Serve in hot dog buns.  Serves 8.
