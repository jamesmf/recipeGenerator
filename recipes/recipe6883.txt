TURNIPS AND PORK CHOPS


  turnips, peeled and boiled until tender
  a little over half of a qt. size bag of turnips
1  large or 2 medium onions, chopped fine
5  to 6 pork chops, deboned and cut up in bite size pieces
3  Tbsp. cooking oil
  salt and pepper to taste or 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper

	Clean and wash pork chops; cut into pieces. Put cooking oil, pork chops, salt and pepper and onions in pot. Smother down until pork chops and onions are brown. Then put in turnips and stir to mix well.
	 The turnips will have some water, so once it cooks out, you have to add a little at a time to finish cooking. Cook over medium heat and smash turnips on side of pot as you stir. When the pork chops are tender and the turnips are no longer in chunks and it is as thick as you want, taste for seasoning and add what you need, then serve over hot rice. (Remember the more you cook, the better it gets.)
