REAL CHICKEN SOUP


1  chicken, cut into 4 pieces
4  stalks celery, cut into 8 pieces
2  large onions whole with stem (easy removal; doesn't disintegrate in soup)
4  carrots, cut into 8 pieces
2  cloves garlic (optional)
1  tsp. turmeric (optional)
1  Tbsp. dry dill and parsley (or 1/2 bunch each, fresh), well washed
1  Tbsp. kosher salt
1/2  tsp. white pepper (black darkens soup)

      Put chicken and salt into large (12 to 14 cup) soup pot and cover with cold water.  Let it come to a boil and lower heat. Remove all gray matter with ladle strainer so soup water is clear and clean.  Then add all vegetables, dill and parsley.  DO NOT LET SOUP BOIL; it must simmer slowly for about 1 1/2 hours.  This is what produces a clear, sweet broth.  Taste for seasoning.
      Separately, cook thin egg noodles and serve with soup and pieces of chicken and vegetables in each bowl.
