CHICKEN PICCATA


1/4  c. flour
  salt and pepper to taste
4  chicken cutlets, pounded until thin
3  Tbsp. butter
2  lemons, one thinly sliced and 1 juiced
3  Tbsp. large capers, drained

      On a plate, mix the flour, salt and pepper. Coat the chicken on both sides with flour mixture.  Shake off excess.
      Heat a large skillet. Melt the butter and add the chicken breasts. Cook over high heat for 3 minutes on each side or until slightly browned and cooked through. Remove the breasts from the skillet.  Keep them warm. Add lemon slices to the pan and cook over medium-high heat, turning often for 1 to 2 minutes or until the lemon is golden.  Add the capers and lemon juice.  Spoon the pan juices and lemons onto the chicken and serve at once.  Serves 4.
