PEANUT BRITTLE
(Church of God Candy)  

3  c. sugar
1  c. white Karo syrup
1/2  c. water
2 1/2  c. raw peanuts
1  tsp. salt
2  tsp. soda
1  Tbsp. margarine

      Combine sugar, syrup and water; bring to boil and boil about 5 minutes (until it strings).  Add peanuts and cook until golden brown (290 degrees; on candy thermometer).  Add salt, soda and margarine (use hard margarine, not whipped or light); stir well.  Pour onto lightly buttered surface; a cookie sheet or aluminum pie pans work well.  Thin candy is more crisp than thick slabs.  Break into pieces and store in airtight cans or bowls.
