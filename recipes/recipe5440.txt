SEVEN-UP SALAD


1  pkg. lemon Jell-O
1  c. boiling water
1 (8 oz.)  pkg. cream cheese
1  can crushed pineapple, drained
1  Tbsp. vanilla
1  Tbsp. sugar
1/2  c. pecans, chopped
1 (10 oz.)  bottle 7-Up
  green food coloring (optional)

	Dissolve Jell-O in boiling water. Beat cheese until light and fluffy. Slowly add Jell-O. Fold in remaining ingredients. Add food coloring to make a nice green color. Chill until firm. Yield: 8 to 12 servings.
	I use Tupperware "snack stor" or an 8 x 8-inch glass dish.
