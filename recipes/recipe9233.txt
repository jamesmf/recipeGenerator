KATHY'S CROCK POT BARBECUE


1  (3 to 4 lb.) pork loin or Boston butt roast
2  Tbsp. sugar
1  tsp. salt
1  c. vinegar
1/2  c. catsup
6 to 8  Tbsp. meat broth
1  Tbsp. worcestershire sauce
  Texas Pete hot sauce, to taste
  bottled barbecue sauce, if desired

      Sear the roast on all sides in a little oil before putting in crock pot.  Add sugar, salt and vinegar.  Start crock pot on high for about 1 hour; reduce heat to low and continue cooking for about 10 hours, or until the meat is so tender that it falls apart.  Remove meat from crock pot; discard any bones and fat. Cut meat into small pieces.  Mix remaining ingredients for sauce and toss with meat.  (Discard all unused drippings from the crock pot.  There is too much vinegar in this to use it all.)  Return meat and sauce to crock pot to keep warm during serving. Delicious!
      Note: If meat is too dry, you can add a little more meat broth or bottled barbecue sauce.
