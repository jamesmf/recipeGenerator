RED VELVET CAKE


1/2  c. shortening
1 1/2  c. sugar
2  eggs
2  Tbsp. cocoa
2  oz. red food coloring
2  c. flour
1  tsp. each salt and soda
1  c. buttermilk
1  Tbsp. each vanilla and vinegar

 
Icing:
3  Tbsp. flour
1  c. each milk and granulated sugar
1/2  lb. butter (margarine won't do)
1/2  tsp. vanilla

      Cream shortening with sugar; add eggs.  Combine cocoa and food coloring to make a paste.  Stir into creamed mixture.  Sift flour and salt together.  Then with electric mixer at medium speed, add alternately with buttermilk to mixture.  Blend well; add vanilla. Combine soda and vinegar; while still foaming, add to batter.  Stir gently.  Bake in 2 greased and floured layer cake pans at 350 degrees; for 30 to 35 minutes.  Icing:  Cook flour and milk over medium heat until thick, stirring constantly.  Cool.  Add sugar, butter and vanilla.  Beat at high speed until smooth and creamy.  Spread on cooled cake.  Icing will take a length of time to set; it resembles whipped cream when cooled.
