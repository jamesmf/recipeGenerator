WHITE CHOCOLATE CHEX MIX


1 1/4  lb. white chocolate
3  c. Rice and Corn Chex
3  c. Cheerios
3  c. pretzel sticks
12  oz. dry roasted peanuts
12  oz. bag M&M's (plain)

	Gently mix all ingredients, except white chocolate. Spread in two 9 x 13-inch pans.
	 Melt white chocolate in microwave for 2 minutes on High, 30 seconds at a time, just until melted. Drizzle over dry ingredients and gently mix with a spoon. Place pans in the refrigerator 20 minutes. (If you leave in longer, it gets too hard.) Take out of the refrigerator and break apart. Store in a covered container.
