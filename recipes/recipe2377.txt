OLD FASHIONED PEACH COBBLER


Pastry:
3  c. sifted all-purpose flour
1  tsp. salt
1  c. shortening
  about 8 Tbsp. water

      Preheat oven to 400 degrees;.  Combine flour and salt; cut in half of shortening until mixture resembles coarse corn meal.  Cut in remaining shortening until mixture is consistency of small peas. Sprinkle water over mixture and stir gently with a fork until mixture holds together.  Press into a smooth ball.  Divide dough in thirds.  On lightly floured board or pastry cloth, roll out one-third of dough to 1/8-inch thickness.  Cut into small pieces, about 1 x 3-inches.  Place on ungreased baking sheet and bake until lightly browned, about 8 minutes.  Cover remaining dough and continue with filling directions.
Filling:
2  c. sugar
3  Tbsp. all-purpose flour
7  c. sliced fresh peaches
1  c. water
1/2  tsp. almond extract
1/2  c. (1 stick) butter or margarine, divided

      Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees;.  Grease a 3-quart baking dish. Stir together sugar and flour.  Add peaches, water and extract; blend carefully.  Roll out one-third of dough to 1/8-inch thickness, shaping to fit into bottom and up sides of dish with a 1-inch overhang.  Spoon half of peach mixture into pastry; dot with half the butter.  Place cooked pastry strips over filling.  Spoon remaining filling over cooked pastry; dot with remaining butter. Roll out remaining one-third dough into 1/8-inch thickness.  Cut into 3/4-inch wide strips and arrange lattice-fashion over filling. Trim edges, seal and flute.  Bake 50 to 60 minutes.  Makes 8 to 10 servings.
