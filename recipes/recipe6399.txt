CUCUMBER AND YOGURT SALAD WITH FRESH HERBS


12  medium sized cucumbers
  salt
6  c. (1 1/2 qt.) plain yogurt
1/2  c. white wine vinegar
1  c. chopped fresh parsley leaves
1/3  c. chopped fresh dill or 1 1/2 Tbsp. dried

  freshly ground black pepper
6  small white onions, thinly sliced and separated into rings
2  heads radicchio, cored and separated into individual leaves, washed, dried, wrapped and refrigerated

      Peel the cucumbers. Cut each in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds and thinly slice the cucumbers. Sprinkle with salt and put into a large colander to drain for 30 minutes. Meanwhile in a large bowl, combine the yogurt, vinegar and herbs and season with salt and pepper to taste.
       Combine the cucumbers and onions in a large bowl. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently. Cover and refrigerate for several hours. Toss again before serving. Arrange the radicchio leaves around the edge of a large shallow bowl or platter. Spoon the salad into the center of the dish.
