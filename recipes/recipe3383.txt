CAPE COD CRANBERRY-PEAR RELISH


1  12-oz. bag fresh cranberries (3 c.)
1 1/4  c. packed light brown sugar
1/4  c. balsamic vinegar
1/2  c. water
1  medium pear, peeled, cored, and diced

      In 3-quart saucepan, heat cranberries, sugar, vinegar, and water to boiling over high heat, stirring frequently.  Reduce heat to low; simmer, uncovered, until most of the cranberries pop, about 20 minutes.  Add diced  pear, cover and cook 10 minutes longer.  Cover and refrigerate relish until well chilled, about 4 hours.  Can be transferred to an airtight container and kept in refrigerator up to 2 days.  Makes about 3 cups.
