LO-CAL ROAST TURKEY WITH CRANBERRY SAUCE


1  (3 to 3 1/2 lb.) fresh or frozen breast of turkey

 
Sauce:
1/2  tsp. finely shredded orange peel
2/3  c. orange juice
1/2  c. sugar
3  c. cranberries

      If using frozen turkey, thaw.  Place turkey, skin side up, on a rack in a shallow roasting pan.  Cover loosely with foil.  Roast in a 325 degrees; oven for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until tender.  Uncover the last 45 minutes of roasting.  Baste occasionally with pan juices.
      Meanwhile, for the sauce, in a medium pan combine orange peel, orange juice and sugar.  Bring to boiling, stirring to dissolve sugar.  Add cranberries; return to boiling.  Reduce heat.  Simmer, uncovered, over medium-low heat for 7 to 8 minutes or until cranberries pop and sauce thickens slightly.  Serve warm with turkey.  Makes 12 servings.
      A delicious and healthful change of pace from traditional turkey and stuffing, and much easier.
