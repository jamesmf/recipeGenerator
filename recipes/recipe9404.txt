FRIED CHICKEN TACOS


1/2  tsp. salt
2  c. shredded cooked chicken
12  soft corn tortillas
3/4  c. sunflower or vegetable oil
1  c. guacamole
2  c. thinly shredded lettuce or cabbage
1/4  lb. salsa made with tomatillos and chilies

      Add salt to chicken.  Mix well.  Place 1 tortilla on a dry comal or frying pan to heat it and make it pliable.  Heat on both sides.  Remove to a plate.  Continue with remaining tortillas. Put a strip of chicken down the center of each tortilla and roll. Either secure with a toothpick or lay them side by side in a baking pan.  Heat oil in a large, heavy frying pan until smoking. With tongs, place each tortilla in hot oil.  Fry until crispy, about 6 minutes, and drain well.  Remove toothpicks.  Top with guacamole and salsa.  Serve immediately.  Makes 12 tacos.
