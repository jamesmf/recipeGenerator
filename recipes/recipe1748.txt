ROAST DUCK, MELON AND MANGO SALAD


  half roasted duck or boiled chicken
5  oz. honey dew melon
1  pear
1/2  cucumber
5  oz. cantaloupe melon
1  mango
4  oz. jicama
3  Tbsp. coarsely grounded toasted peanuts
2  Tbsp. toasted white seasame seeds
1  coriander plant

 
Marinade for Duck:
1/2  Tbsp. light soya sauce
2  tsp. fine sugar
1  tsp. oyster sauce
1  Tbsp. cooked vegetable oil

      Remove flesh from duck and cut into fine strips.  Cut flesh of melon, mango, cucumber, pear and jicama into fine strips, discarding skin and pulp first.
      Arrange each vegetable and fruit neatly around a large serving platter, varying the colors.  Put the duck in the center, after first marinating it in the sauce.
      Top with a sprinkling of peanuts, sesame seeds and plucked coriander leaves.  Chill in the fridge.
Sauce:
3  Tbsp. water
1/2  tsp. salt
1 to 2  tsp. sugar
1/2  tsp. sesame oil
1/2  Tbsp. tomato ketchup
1  tsp. chilli sauce
1 1/2  tsp. cornflour
1  1/2 Chinese plum sauce or apricot jam
2  tsp. vegetable oil

      Mix all the sauce ingredients together except for the oil and plum sauce.  Heat oil in a wok and add the mixture.  Stir well until sauce thickens.  Add plum sauce or apricot jam and turn off heat.  Cool in the fridge.
      To serve, pour the sauce over the duck at the table and all the guests should toss the salad together.
