SPANISH MEATBALLS
(Albondigas)  

1  lb. ground beef
4  oz. ground chorizo or other spicy sausage
3/4  tsp. salt
  dash of nutmeg
1  Tbsp. finely chopped fresh parsley
2  slices bread, soaked in water
1  egg
3  Tbsp. olive oil
1  cube beef bouillon (optional)
1  c. water (optional)

      Combine meat, salt, nutmeg and parsley in a large bowl. Squeeze water from bread and add bread and egg to meat mixture. Form into 36 small balls.  In a frying pan, heat olive oil and saut√© meatballs until thoroughly cooked and brown (about 20 minutes).  Serve immediately.
      If desired as appetizers, provide toothpicks or party skewers. To keep meatballs warm in a thin sauce, dissolve 1 cube beef bouillon in 1 cup boiling water and pour over meatballs.  Keep warm over low heat.
