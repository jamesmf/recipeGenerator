CORN CRISP CHICKEN


3  lb. frying chicken, cut up, rinse and pat dry
1 1/2  c. corn flakes crumbs
1/2  c. evaporated milk
1  tsp. salt
  Black pepper (optional)

      Dip chicken pieces in evaporated milk.  Roll in mixture of corn flakes and salt (a little pepper if you wish).  Place chicken, skin side up, in foil-lined shallow 9 x 13-inch baking pan. For added flavor, drizzle with melted butter or margarine. Do not cover pan while baking.  Cover loosely with foil if less crisp crust is desired.  Bake for about 1 hour at 350 degrees;.
