FREEZE AHEAD MEAT SAUCE


3  lb. lean ground beef
3  medium onions, chopped
2  cloves garlic, minced
2 1/2  tsp. salt
3 (1 lb.)  cans tomatoes
1 (6 oz.)  can sliced mushrooms
3 (6 oz.)  cans tomato paste
1 1/2  c. water
2  bay leaves
1  Tbsp. basil
1/4  tsp. cinnamon
1  Tbsp. oregano
1/2  tsp. thyme
1/2  tsp. pepper sauce
1/3  c. chopped parsley

      Break up ground beef in large pot. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until some fat has collected. Add onion, garlic and salt. Cook until onion and garlic are tender. Add remaining ingredients. Simmer 1 hour until sauce is thickened. Let cool and if too much fat has accumulated, skim off. Pack in pint or quart freezer containers and freeze. Makes 3 quarts.
      Suggested Uses for Sauce: For risotto Romano, use 1 quart meat sauce, heated. Place heated meat sauce in center of 2 cups cooked rice in casserole and cover with 8 ounces sliced Mozzarella. Place in moderate oven until cheese melts. Also use on thin spaghetti, sprinkled with Parmesan or you can use egg noodles.
