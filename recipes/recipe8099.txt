CHICKEN AND GREEN APPLE FAJITAS


4  boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed
1/4  c. tequila
1  dried ancho chili, chopped
1  tsp. cumin seed, ground
1  tsp. coriander seed, ground
1  tsp. ground black pepper
2  cloves garlic, crushed
2  Tbsp. olive oil
1  red onion, sliced into strips
  red bell pepper, sliced into strips
1  Granny Smith apple, sliced

	Marinate chicken cubes in tequila, ancho chili, cumin, coriander, black pepper, garlic and olive oil for about an hour. Using a cast iron skillet or griddle, heat a little olive oil. Cook chicken on medium high heat, with marinade, until it is browned and liquid has reduced.  Add the other ingredients (except apples) and cook until chicken is thoroughly cooked and vegetables begin to become tender.  It is crucial to NOT overcook the chicken and vegetables.  Add apples and cook for 1 - 2 minutes.  Remove from heat.	May be served with warm tortillas, sour cream, diced tomatoes, grated cheese and fresh cilantro for garnish.
