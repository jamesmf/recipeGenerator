CLAM CHOWDER


1/4  lb. salt pork, diced
4  c. potatoes, diced
1/2  c. onion, diced
2  doz. medium size clams, cooked & chopped*
2  c. liquid from clams (either cooked broth or from a can)
1  c. light cream
2  c. milk
3  Tbsp. flour
1 1/2  tsp. salt
  Dash of pepper

      Fry salt pork until crispy, remove pork and use the drippings. Add 2 cups of clam juice, diced potatoes and diced onions to the fat.  Cook covered 20 minutes until potatoes are cooked.  Add clams, 1 3/4 cups of milk and the cream.  Blend the remaining milk and flour together, stir this into the chowder.  Heat to boil stirring occasionally.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Serves 10 small bowls - serve with the cooked salt pork on top.
      Note:  I always double the recipe and use a heavy stock pot to cook it in.
      *(If using canned clams, I use a large can of chopped sea clams.)
