E-Z EGGPLANT PARMESAN


  Eggplant
  Olive oil
  Breadcrumbs
  Italian sauce
  Grated Parmesan cheese

      Slice eggplant into 1/2 inch thick slices.  (Leave skin on.) Put olive oil in bowl and dip slices of eggplant in oil.  Be sure to cover both sides.  Press into seasoned breadcrumbs.  Place on cookie sheet.  Place pan on middle rack in preheated 425 degrees; oven for 15 minutes.  Flip slices over and cook for another 15 minutes. Spread Italian seasoned sauce, like "Prego" on top of each slice and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and cook for 3 to 5 more minutes.  This is easy and delicious.  No fuss, little clean up.
