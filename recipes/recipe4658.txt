JERK SAUCE


1  tbsp Allspice
1  tbsp Thyme
1  1/2 tsp Cayenne Pepper
1  1/2 tsp Black Pepper
1  1/2 tsp Ground Sage
3/4  tsp Nutmeg
3/4  tsp Cinnamon
2  tbsp Garlic Powder
1  tbsp Sugar
1/4  cup Olive Oil
1/4  cup Soy Sauce
3/4  cup White Vinegar
1/2  cup Orange Juice (not from concentrate)
  Juice of 1 Lime
1  Scotch Bonnet or Habanero Pepper (finely chopped)
3  green onions (finely chopped)
1  cup onion (white or yellow; finely chopped)

      In a large bowl combine the spices and sugar (first 9 ingredients).  Combine the liquid ingredients together and using a wire whisk, slowly add to the bowl of spices.  Add the Scotch Bonnet and onions and mix well.  Pour into a wide mouth jar or container with a lid and let set over night in the refrigerator so the flavors blend.  Shake well before using.  Can be used as a marinade for Chicken, Beef or Pork,  coat and let set for at least 1 hour before cooking.  Can be cooked any style.  Also makes a great dipping sauce.  It's really good and quite easy.
