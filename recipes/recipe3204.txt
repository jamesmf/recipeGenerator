RANCH STARS


1  c. ranch salad dressing
1/4  c. finely chopped green bell peppers
1  c. shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1  c. shredded cheddar cheese
1 1/2  c. ground pork sausage (your choice of flavor)
1 small  can finely chopped black olives
1  pkg. wonton wrappers

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Brown pork sausage in pan, drain and blot with paper towels to absorb excess oils.  Using a non-stick muffin tin (or non-stick spray), place two wonton wrappers criss-crossed to form a star in each compartment.  Lightly toast wonton wrappers in oven while doing next step. Wrappers should be somewhat toasty, very lightly browned.  Mix all ingredients together in large bowl to make filling.  Remove wrappers from oven, and dip filling into each star in the muffin pan.  When all stars are filled, return muffin tin to oven and cook until wrappers turn darker brown but not burned.
       Some variations:  Put shredded cheese on top of filling.  Use different cheese.  Add finely chopped mushrooms.  Add green onions.  Use chicken instead of pork sausage.  Makes 24 large stars.
