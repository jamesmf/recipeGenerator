MAMIE'S YAMS


4  large yams
1  Tbsp. orange juice
1  tsp. grated orange peel
1  tsp. vanilla
1/2  tsp. nutmeg
1/4  tsp. cinnamon
1  Tbsp. butter
1  egg, lightly beaten
1/2  c. whole milk
2  Tbsp. fructose

      Boil the yams with the skins left on until tender.  Take them out of the water and cool.  Peel the yams and mash them.  Add orange juice, orange peel, vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon and butter. Mix well.  Beat the egg lightly.  Mix the milk and fructose into the beaten egg and add this mixture to the yams.  Beat with a rotary beater until fluffy.  Bake at 325 degrees; for 20 minutes.  Turn off the oven and leave the yams in it for 1/2 hour longer.  This makes a nice cold side dish with a leftover turkey sandwich.
