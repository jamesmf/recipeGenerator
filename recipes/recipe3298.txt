TEXAS TOMATO TEA SANDWICHES


3  medium Texas-grown tomatoes
4  to 6 medium-sized fresh basil leaves
5  to 6 leaves Italian parsley
  French sea salt
  white pepper
1/2  lb. (2 sticks) unsalted butter
8  slices Pepperidge Farm or other very thinly sliced bread

      Slice the tomatoes thinly, lightly salt and place on a baking sheet that has been lined with paper towels. Let the tomatoes drain for several hours.
      Chop 2 to 3 of the basil leaves and 2 to 3 of the Italian parsley leaves very finely and mix with the unsalted butter until light and creamy. Add French sea salt and white pepper to taste.
       Cut the crusts off 8 slices of bread and spread with a thin layer of butter mixed with herbs. Layer various colors of tomatoes on the butter. Cut the bread into 4 squares, rectangles or triangles. Chiffonade the remaining herbs and sprinkle over tomatoes. Cover with a damp tea towel if not served immediately. Makes 32 sandwiches.
