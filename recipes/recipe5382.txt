MINI MEATBALL SOUP


2  Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
2  carrots, peeled and chopped
2  ribs celery, chopped
1  medium onion, chopped
2  bay leaves (fresh or dried)
  salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1  lb. ground beef, pork and veal combined
1  beaten egg
2  cloves garlic, minced
1/2  c. Parmigiano or Romano cheese, grated
1/2  c. plain bread crumbs
1/2  tsp. freshly grated or ground nutmeg
6  c. chicken stock or broth
2  c. water
1 1/2  c. dried pasta (rings, elbow, ziti)
1  lb. triple washed fresh spinach, coarsely chopped

	In a deep pot over medium heat, add oil, chopped carrots, celery, onions and bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Cover pot and cook veggies 5 or 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. While the veggies cook, combine meat, egg, garlic, grated cheese, bread crumbs, salt, pepper and nutmeg.
	Uncover your soup pot and add broth and water to the pot. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. When soup boils, reduce heat a bit and start to roll meat mixture into small balls, dropping them straight into the pot. You are making meat dumplings that will cook in the broth. When you are done rolling the meat, add pasta to the soup and stir. Cover and simmer soup 10 minutes. When pasta is tender, stir in chopped spinach in batches. When spinach has wilted into the soup, the soup is done and ready to serve. Adjust your seasonings to your preference.
