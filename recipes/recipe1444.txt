LEMON CHICKEN


1/2  c. lemon juice
1/2  c. (1 stick) butter or margarine, melted
1  tsp. leaf thyme, crumbled or 1 Tbsp. minced fresh thyme
1/4  tsp. liquid red pepper seasoning
2  broiler-fryers (about 2 1/2 lb. each), quartered
  salt
  freshly ground pepper

      Combine lemon juice, butter or margarine, thyme and pepper seasoning in small bowl.  Sprinkle the chickens with salt and pepper.  Place chickens, bone side down, on the grill over hot coals.  Brush with the basting sauce.  Grill for 40 minutes, turning over once.  Baste frequently with the sauce.  Serve with the remaining basting sauce poured over the chickens.
      Note:  Adjust the heat if chicken is cooking too fast.  Makes 4 to 6 servings.
