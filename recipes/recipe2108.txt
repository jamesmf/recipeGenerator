OLD-FASHIONED LOAF CANDY


6  c. white sugar
1  pt. white corn syrup
1  pt. cream or half and half
1  lb. unsalted butter
1  lb. chopped nuts
2  tsp. vanilla

      Mix all ingredients in a large heavy pan.  Place over medium heat.  Bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  Cook to a medium firm soft-ball stage.  This will take 40 minutes to 1 hour.  You must constantly stir or candy will burn.  (I try about 1 teaspoon in a cup of cold water.  When it can be picked up with no effort, then candy is cooked.)  Remove from heat.  Continue to stir and beat. When candy begins to stiffen, add the nuts and continue to stir. Candy will get very stiff and hard to stir.  When it will hold its shape, mold into loaf.  Wrap and chill.  Can be frozen.
      Butter your hands before you work with the candy.  It will still be very hot, so be careful.  (I add 1/4 teaspoon black walnut flavoring and 1 teaspoon maple flavoring.  Also, I cook the nuts in the candy.  Sometimes I add more than the pound of nuts.  Black walnuts are the best, then pecans.  I shape it into long rolls and wrap in aluminum foil.  Keeps a long while in the freezer and flavor is improved.)
