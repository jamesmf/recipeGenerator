LEMON JELL-O SALAD


1  pkg. Jell-O, lemon or lime flavor
  carrots, grated
  cabbage, grated
  green pepper, grated
1/2  grated onion (optional)
  radishes
  mayonnaise or yogurt
  paprika

	While Jell-O is thickening, grate other ingredients medium-fine.  Mix all ingredients into semi-formed Jell-O.	When Jell-O firms, cut into squares.  Put in center of crisp lettuce leaf.  Add one dab of mayonnaise or yogurt.  Sprinkle dab with a little paprika for color.  I usually prepare this salad in the morning to save time later.
