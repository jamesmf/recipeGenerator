GRILLED DRY RIBS AND SAUCE

Grilled Ribs:
1  Tbsp. salt
2  tsp. coarsely ground black pepper
1/2  tsp. crushed hot red pepper
6  lb. pork spareribs
  Rib Sauce (see following)
4  to 6 handfuls hickory chips

      Combine salt and peppers; rub mixture all over ribs.  Let ribs stand in refrigerator for 4 hours.  Bring to room temperature before cooking.  Soak wood chips for 30 minutes.  Prepare a medium-hot fire in a covered charcoal grill.  Push coals to one side.  Just before cooking, toss 1/2 of the wood chips onto the coals.  Grill ribs on the side of the grill away from the coals. Turn about every 30 minutes.  Add remaining wood chips after 45 minutes.  Cook until ribs are crusty on the outside and tender on the inside, about 1 1/2 hours.  Serve with Rib Sauce (follows).
Rib Sauce:
2  c. bottled chili sauce
1/3  c. cider vinegar
1/3  c. ketchup
1/3  c. dark brown sugar
3  Tbsp. soy sauce
3  Tbsp. dry sherry
1 1/2  tsp. ground ginger
3/4 to 1  tsp. crushed red pepper
2  garlic cloves, crushed

      Combine all ingredients in a saucepan.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce just coats a spoon (about 20 minutes). Will keep in refrigerator for 1 week.
