DROP COOKIES


1 1/2  c. raisins
1/2  c. oleo
2  Tbsp. Sucaryl or liquid artificial sweetener
1  egg
1  c. cream, buttermilk or canned milk
1/4  tsp. each:  cloves, nutmeg and allspice
1/2  c. chopped nuts
1  c. flour
1  c. oatmeal
1  tsp. cinnamon
1  tsp. soda
  vanilla

      Cook raisins in a small amount of water, until water is about gone; add oleo and set aside to cool.  Add all other ingredients together; mix with raisins and oleo mixture.  Then drop on a greased cookie sheet, 2-inches apart.  Bake at 375 degrees; until done. These take a little longer than regular cookie dough.  Also, they must be refrigerated or they will mold.
