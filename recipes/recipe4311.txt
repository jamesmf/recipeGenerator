RED LEAF SALAD


1  bunch red leaf lettuce
1 or 2  bunches green onions
1/2 to 1  pkg. fresh mushrooms
1  to 2 avocados
1  can artichoke hearts (not marinated)
1  pkg. Good Seasons Italian dressing

      Mix Good Seasons almost according to directions: Use olive oil (I use 3/4 olive oil and 1/4 regular oil). No water. Add extra garlic powder.
      In dressing, put chopped onions, sliced mushrooms, sliced artichoke hearts and let marinate while rest of dinner is being prepared.
       Break up lettuce and when ready to serve, have avocados bite size pieces. Pour dressing over. Stir and serve.
