APRICOT STUFFED ROLLED ROAST


3 1/2  lb. sirloin tip roast
2  tsp. meat tenderizer
2  tsp. Greek seasoning
2  Tbsp. onion flakes
1  tsp. salt

 
Stuffing:
1/2  lb. bacon
1/2  c. chopped onion
1  c. sliced celery
3  c. shredded carrots
1  tsp. Greek seasoning

 
Glaze:
1 (7 1/2 oz.)  jar baby food apricots
1/2  c. brown sugar
2  Tbsp. steak sauce

      To prepare the roast, slice a 3/4-inch slice across the top of the roast to within 3/4-inch of the other side; turn roast over, then on the opposite side from the first cut, slice 3/4-inch slice across to within 3/4-inch of the other side.  Unfold the meat. Sprinkle 1/2 of the meat tenderizer, Greek seasoning, onion flakes and salt on one side of the meat and pound with steak hammer.  Turn over and repeat other side.  Heat a large frying pan and brown both sides of meat; remove from pan and let cool.
      Stuffing:  Slice the bacon into 1-inch strips and fry in large frypan; remove the bacon and add the onion and celery.  Sauté. Then add the carrots and sauté until tender.  Remove from heat and stir in Greek seasoning and bacon.  Place the stuffing lengthwise of the meat; pull the meat up together over the stuffing and hold together with wooden toothpicks.
      Combine the glaze ingredients (set aside).  Place meat roll in the microwave, top side down, for 6 minutes on High.  Turn meat over and microwave for 6 minutes on High, if using a carousel.  If not, turn meat about every 3 minutes while cooking.  Brush on glaze as meat is cooking.  Place the meat on large serving platter and garnish with parsley, red canned crab apples and whole apricots. Serves 8 to 10.
