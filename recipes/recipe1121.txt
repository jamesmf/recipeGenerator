STUFFED BELL PEPPERS


1  lb. very lean ground round
4  bell peppers
1  medium-large onion, chopped small
2 small  cans tomato sauce
2  c. cooked rice
  bacon bits

      Cut top off bell pepper and remove stem and seeds.  Put peppers in boiling water about 5 minutes or until they turn lighter in color.  This helps to keep the pepper from splitting when stuffed. Spray a large skillet with Pam and saut√© the onion and the top slice off pepper (chopped).  Add meat and cook until red is gone from meat.  Add the rice and tomato sauce.  Mix well and fill peppers.  If there is any stuffing leftover, put it in the baking dish and put peppers on top.  Add a few bacon bits on top of each pepper and bake at 350 degrees;, covered, about 1 hour.  One pepper equals approximately 1 vegetable, 3 meats, 1 starch and 1 fat.
