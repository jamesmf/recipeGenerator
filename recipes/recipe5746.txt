BARBECUE SAUCE


1/2  c. chopped onion
3  Tbsp. oleo
1  c. ketchup
1/4  c. vinegar
2  Tbsp. brown sugar
1/2  c. water
2  tsp. yellow mustard
1  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
  salt and pepper to taste

      Slowly cook onions in oleo until tender.  Add remaining ingredients and simmer about 5 minutes.  This sauce is very good for chicken or pork.  I often add browned spareribs and simmer for about an hour.  Excellent!  Recipe easily doubles.
