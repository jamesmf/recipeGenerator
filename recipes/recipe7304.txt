GUMBO YA-YA

Poached Chicken:
10  c. cold water
1  (3 lb.) whole chicken
1  medium onion, quartered
1  celery rib, cut into 6 pieces
1  bay leaf
1 1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper

 
Gumbo:
3/4  c. each vegetable oil and flour
3/4  lb. andouille, chorizo or other smoked spicy sausage
1  c. chopped onions
1/2  c. each chopped green bell pepper and celery
1  Tbsp. each chopped scallion and fresh parsley
  cooked rice (optional)

      Chicken: In a large pot, combine the water, chicken, onion, celery, bay leaf, salt and cayenne. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; skim foam from top. Simmer, partially covered, 1 hour, until cooked through. Remove chicken; let cool. Strain broth through sieve; reserve broth and discard solids.
      Gumbo: In Dutch oven, whisk oil and flour until blended (roux). Cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until dark brown, about 15 minutes.
       Finely chop 1/4 pound sausage; slice remaining sausage 1/4-inch thick. Add chopped sausage, onions, bell pepper and celery to roux; cook, stirring until vegetables have softened, 8 minutes. Add 5 cups reserved broth (save remainder for another use). Simmer, stirring occasionally, 1 hour.
      Remove skin from chicken.  Tear meat into large pieces; discard skin and bones.  Add chicken and sliced sausage to gumbo.  Simmer 15 minutes.  Skim off fat.  Stir in scallion and parsley.  Serve with rice, if desired.  Makes 6 servings.
