BRISSLETS


2 1/2  c. sugar
1  c. butter
3  large eggs
1  c. whipping cream
3  Tbsp. vanilla
6  c. flour, sifted
1  tsp. salt

      Cream butter with sugar.  Add eggs and vanilla.  Alternately add flour and cream.  Chilling the dough overnight is best.  Make dough in balls, 3/4-inch in diameter.  Bake in iron.  Electric irons can be purchased.  If using an electric iron, use 1 cup eggs and 5 1/3 cups flour (sift before measuring).  Then add sugar, butter, cream and vanilla as in original recipe.
