CANDY BAR BROWNIES


3/4  c. butter or margarine, melted
2  c. sugar
4  eggs
2  tsp. vanilla
1 1/2  c. all-purpose flour
1/3  c. cocoa
1/2  tsp. baking powder

4  Snickers bars (2.07 oz.), cut into pieces
3  Hershey plain milk chocolate candy bars, chopped coarsely

      In a bowl, combine butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla.  Combine flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt.  Set aside 1/4 cup of this dry mixture; add remaining dry ingredients to the egg mixture.  Mix well.  Toss Snickers bar pieces with reserved flour mixture; stir into batter.  Grease a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan.  Pour in batter and sprinkle milk chocolate candy bar pieces over top of batter. Bake at 350 degrees; for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Do not overbake.  Chill before cutting.  Can do ahead.  Makes 3 dozen.
