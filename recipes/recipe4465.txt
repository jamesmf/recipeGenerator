WILD RICE SOUP


1/2  lb. bacon, fried and chopped
1  onion, chopped and fried
2  cans potato soup
2  cans water
1  pt. half and half or milk will work
1  Tbsp. chicken bouillon
1  c. rinsed and cooked wild rice
1  c. shredded Cheddar cheese

      Add the soup, water, half and half and chicken bouillon to the bacon and onion. Heat. I like to add 2 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 2 teaspoons water. Add to the above the rice and cheese. Mix, heat and serve. Can add turkey, chicken or ham.
