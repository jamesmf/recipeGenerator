GREEN BEANS ON THE GRILL


1  lb. green beans
1  medium onion, sliced or diced
1/2  green pepper, sliced or diced
1  c. fresh mushrooms, chopped (I used 4 oz. can, drained)
1/3  c. butter
2 or 3  tsp. horseradish
2  Tbsp. brown sugar
1 1/2  tsp. salt
  pepper (as much as desired)

      Mix butter, horseradish, brown sugar, salt and pepper.  Dab this mixture over green beans and wrap in heavy-duty foil and put on grill for 20 minutes.  Remove and cut up 1 or 2 tomatoes into wedges and place over top of beans, return to grill for 10 to 15 minutes more.  Unwrap and enjoy!
