MAMA'S MEAT LOAF


2  lb. ground beef
1  small onion, chopped
2  slightly beaten eggs
1 1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. black pepper
1  c. cracker crumbs
1/2  c. milk

      You also need a 9 x 13 pan.
      Mix well. Shape into 3 loaves. Pour 1 can chopped tomatoes over loaves. Drizzle catsup over tomatoes. Top each loaf with a slice of bacon. Bake at 350 degrees; about 45 minutes.
      We always had beans and fried potatoes.
