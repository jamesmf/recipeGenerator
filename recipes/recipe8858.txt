MEXICAN CASSEROLE


2  lb. ground beef
1  large onion
1  bud garlic
1  can mild enchilada sauce
1/4  can water
1  can cream of chicken soup
1  can cream of mushroom soup
1/2  can chopped Ro-Tel tomatoes with green chilies
1/2  lb. Velveeta cheese
1/2  can water
  Doritos nacho cheese
1/2  lb. shredded Cheddar cheese

      Fry ground beef, onion and garlic and drain. Add enchilada sauce and 1/4 can water and simmer. Mix and melt in saucepan the soups, tomatoes, 1/2 pound Velveeta cheese and 1/2 can water. Melt slowly and stir often until cheese is melted. Line bottom of long Pyrex or Corning pan with Doritos nacho cheese. Put 1/2 of meat mixture over the Doritos, then 1/2 of soup mixture over that. Crumble some more of Doritos, then other 1/2 of meat mixture, ending up with other 1/2 of soup mixture. Bake at 350 degrees; until hot and bubbles in middle. Remove and sprinkle 1/2 pound shredded Cheddar cheese on top. Serve immediately.
      This dish can be fixed 3 or 4 days ahead of time and kept in the refrigerator because it's all cooked. Bake at 350 degrees; for 30 minutes or until you can see it bubble in middle. Then I put my shredded Cheddar cheese on top when I take it out of the oven and set it in middle of table. Eat immediately. Eat with garlic buttered French bread or Fritos mashed down in plate and a dip of hot casserole on top. Eat with tossed salad. Makes a complete meal.
      Stretch this dish with 2 cans Ranch Style beans. Cheddar cheese is the stretchy kind that goes on top. I have used Velveeta or American on top. Just try one kind of cheese. I have shredded my cheese ahead of time, set it on table and let each one sprinkle on their serving. Just don't use Cheddar cheese in your soup mixture. It stretches and doesn't look nice.
