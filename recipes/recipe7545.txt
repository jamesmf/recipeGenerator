CHARLOTTE'S CHICKEN ROTEL SPAGHETTI


1  Tbsp. of oleo
1  can of diced/chopped black olives
1  diced medium onion

1  can diced Rotel
16  oz. of Velveeta, cubed
2 1/2  c. cooked diced chicken breast
1 (7 oz.)  pkg. of vermicelli, cooked and drained

      Saut√© onions, pepper, and olives in oleo.  Add soup, Rotel, Velveeta, and chicken.  Mix with vermicelli.  Bake in large casserole dish (I spray mine with Pam to ensure it's easier to clean) at 350 degrees; until hot and bubbly.
