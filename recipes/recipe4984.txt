EL PORTON'S WHITE CHEESE DIP


1  lb. white American cheese
  Finely chopped jalapeno peppers
  Milk

      Cube cheese and put in saucepan.  Over medium-low heat, add just enough milk to melt the cheese to the desired consistency, stirring constantly so cheese doesn't burn.  Blend in finely chopped jalapenos to taste.
