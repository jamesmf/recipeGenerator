CHRISTMAS CANDY WREATH


1  wire coat hanger
5  yards (2-inches wide)
  material (an old piece of cotton sheet works well)
4  feet aluminum foil
1  spool fine wire
4  lb. individually wrapped assorted candies
1  ribbon bow
1  pair scissors

      Cut coat hanger in center of wire base and then bring ends together.  Shape into approximately 10-inch circle; wire ends together with fine wire.  Cover circle by winding the 2-inch material using the entire 5 yards to form the base.  Then, wrap the foil around the material.  The fine wire for putting candy on the wreath should be in about 4 foot lengths or whatever length is convenient to work with.  When the preferred length is used, make a loop on the end by bending the end back and then twisting.  Place next wire through loop; bend end over and twist, thereby fastening ends.
      Begin by fastening fine wire at base of hook.  Twist wire around candy wrapper as tight and close to candy as possible. Twist around candy wrapper twice.  Place pieces as close together as possible.  This will make the wreath fuller.  Foil should not show through.  Repeat this until complete.
      Place scissors on a narrow piece of ribbon and tie to wreath hanger on top.  These will be used for cutting candy off rather than to pull or tear.  Use large bow over hook and hang wreath in well observed position.
