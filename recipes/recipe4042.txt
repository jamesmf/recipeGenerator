STUFFED MUSHROOMS


1/3  c. parmesan cheese
1/2  c. green onion tops, chopped
3  oz. Philadelphia brand cream cheese, no substitute
10  to 12 mushroom caps

      Have cream cheese at room temperature.  Soft, fat free or off brand cream cheese will not work.  Mix cream cheese, parmesan and green onions until well mixed.   Wash and dry mushroom caps. Mound filling in mushroom caps.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until cheese mixture is browned on top.  To stuff approximately 60 mushroom caps, use 3 8 oz. cream cheese, 2 cups parmesan cheese, and 2 bunches of green onion, tops only.
