ZAUNER KRAPFEN
(Austrian Nut Butter Cookie)  

1  c. sifted flour
2/3  c. hazelnuts, walnuts or pecans, ground
1/2  c. soft butter
1/3  c. sugar

      Blend butter into other ingredients using spoon.  Chill 1 to 2 hours.  Roll out on floured pastry cloth or board to 1/8-inch thickness.  Cut into round with 2 1/4-inch cutter.  Place on ungreased baking sheet and bake at 375 degrees; for 7 to 10 minutes, until light golden brown.  These cookies are delicious plain or made into a sandwich cookie, filling with a Chocolate Buttercream Frosting. The Austrian manner is to spread the top of sandwich with a thin jam and dribble a chocolate icing on top.  Then sprinkle with slivered almonds.
