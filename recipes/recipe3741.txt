ARMADILLO EGGS


10  jalapenos
  block cheese (flavor of your choice)
  Owen's sausage
  Shake 'n Bake Hot-N-Spicy

	Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Wash off the jalapenos and take a knife and make a slit into the top part of it.  Remove seeds; use water to get the rest of seeds out.  (You can also use your finger to make sure all seeds are out.)  Insert a chunk of any type of cheese you want into the jalapeno.  Take Owen's sausage and divide into 10 equal portions.  Wrap a portion of sausage around each jalapeno making sure to cover entirely.  Drop each one into Shake 'n Bake Hot-N-Spicy bag and shake thoroughly coating the sausage.  Remove from the bag.  Place on a foil covered baking pan.	Bake for 1 hour (checking every 15 minutes to rotate jalapenos to ensure even browning) or until sausage is crispy brown.
	This is a delicious "hot" appetizer.
