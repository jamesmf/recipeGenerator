HOT CRAB DIP


1/4  lb. butter
2  Tbsp. all-purpose flour
2  c. heavy cream
1  Tbsp. whole sweet basil
1  tsp. ground thyme
1  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. white pepper
1/2  lb. cream cheese
1  lb. lump crabmeat, cleaned of shell

      In a 2 quart skillet, melt butter and add flour.  Whisk flour until completely blended.  Add heavy cream a little at a time, whisking constantly until blended.  Keep heat on high and continue to whisk until mixture thickens.  Add basil, thyme, salt and white pepper; whisk until blended.  Bring mixture to a medium boil and slowly add cream cheese a little at a time, whisking or stirring until blended.  If mixture is too thick, add a little milk until mixture is perfect for dipping.  Remove from heat; add crabmeat. Stir gently until completely blended.  Cover and allow to sit, off the stove, for 10 minutes.  Serve hot with crackers or with pastry shells.
