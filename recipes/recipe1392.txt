BEEF SHISH KABOBS


3  lb. tender beef (in 1 1/2-inch cubes)
18  fresh mushroom caps
  fresh onions
2  large green peppers
18  cherry tomatoes
1 (20 oz.)  can pineapple chunks

 
Marinade:
1/3  c. cider vinegar
1/3  c. tomato catsup
1  tsp. seasoned salt
2  Tbsp. soy sauce
1/2  c. brown sugar
1  tsp. ground ginger

      You will also need heavy-duty Reynolds Wrap.
      Drain pineapple; add water to syrup to make 1 cup.  Combine with remaining marinade ingredients and pour over meat.  Cover and marinate 2 to 4 hours in refrigerator.
      Cut peppers into 2-inch squares.  Thread beef cubes on skewers, alternating with vegetables and pineapple.  Place each kabob on sheet of heavy-duty Reynolds Wrap.  Spoon remaining marinade over kabobs.  Bring up foil; seal top and ends with double fold.  Place foil "bundles" on grill about 3 inches above very hot coals.  Grill 30 minutes, turning several times.  Serves 6.
