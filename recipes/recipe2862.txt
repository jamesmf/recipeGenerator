CINNAMON ROLL


2  c. sugar
1  can evaporated milk
1  stick butter
1  tsp. vanilla
  pecan halves

      Combine sugar, milk and butter in large saucepan.  Cook over medium-high heat to soft-ball stage, stirring constantly.  Take off heat; whip until it loses its gloss and starts to harden.  Add vanilla and beat in well.  Add pecan halves until candy is used up. Tear off waxed paper, about 2 feet long.  Sprinkle cinnamon about 4-inches wide down center of waxed paper.  Drop candy on paper, forming into a log.  Let harden.  Slice and eat.  Can be frozen and served later.  Be sure to wrap in foil to freeze or keep out.
