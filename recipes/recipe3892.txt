4  lb. cucumbers, sliced
3  onions, sliced
1/2  c. coarse salt
5  c. sugar
5  c. cider vinegar
1 1/2  tsp. turmeric
1 1/2  tsp. celery seed

      Cover cucumbers, onions and salt with cold water and about 12 to 14 ice cubes. (Ice cubes help make the pickle crisp.) Let sit about 3 to 4 hours in a glass container. (Metal containers make pickles taste funny. You can divide cucumbers, onions and salt into 3 or 4 large bowls if necessary. Just make sure to divide evenly.) Mix sugar, vinegar, turmeric and celery seed and simmer 30 minutes. Pour cold water off cucumbers and onion mixture and pack them in jars. Cover with hot liquid. Process 10 minutes in hot water bath.
