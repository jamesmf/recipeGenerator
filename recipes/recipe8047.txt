COUNTRY STYLE POT ROAST


2 to 3  lb. pot roast
1 (2 lb.)  can plum tomatoes
2  tsp. caraway seed
  pinch of salt
1/4  tsp. black pepper
4  potatoes, peeled and quartered
6  carrots, peeled and quartered
6  stalks celery (about 2 inch quarters) quartered
12  mushrooms

	Brown the meat in a small amount of the tomato liquid and drain, if necessary, to remove excess fat.	Add  tomatoes and seasonings.  Cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours; then add potatoes, carrots, celery and onions.  Cover and simmer about 1 hour until vegetables are crisp-tender.  Add mushrooms and simmer 15 minutes. Delicious! (Sometimes I add a couple of drops of Tabasco sauce to spice it up since we cut down on the salt.)
