ITALIAN GRILLED SIRLOIN STEAK


6  sliced sirloin tips (very thin)
1  can stewed tomatoes, drained
1  green pepper, diced (optional)
1  pkg. Mozzarella cheese, grated
1/2  c. Italian bread crumbs
1/2  c. Romano and Parmesan cheese, mixed
  dash of garlic powder

      Put stewed tomatoes, green pepper and Mozzarella cheese in a bowl and mix together.  Put about a tablespoon (or more) on each steak, then roll steak.  In another bowl mix Italian bread crumbs, Romano and Parmesan cheese and garlic powder.  Dip and roll steak in this mixture.  You might need toothpicks to hold together.  Cook on grill in foil until steak is done.  You can pound steak to make it thin or have it sliced very thin.  Serves 6.
