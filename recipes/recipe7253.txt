CHILI BLANCO


4  c. diced cooked chicken
10  c. chicken broth
2 garlic cloves, minced or 1/4  tsp. garlic powder
2  medium onions, chopped
1  Tbsp. oil
2 (4 oz.)  cans green chilies, chopped
3  c. canned tomatoes, chopped and juice
2  tsp. ground comino
1 1/2  tsp. oregano
1/4  tsp. ground cloves
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper (optional)
  salt to taste
  cooked rice (about 2 c.)
  grated Monterey Jack cheese (for garnish)

      Cook and dice chicken. Make sure you have 10 cups of broth. (When I use chicken breasts or filets instead of a whole chicken, I put chicken bouillon cubes in broth to make it a bit richer.) In a skillet, saut√© onions in oil until tender. Add chilies, tomatoes, juice and seasonings. Mix thoroughly and cook about 10 minutes. Add to chicken broth. Add chicken and continue to simmer 1 hour. Add cooked rice about 30 minutes before done. Taste for salt. Garnish with grated cheese.
