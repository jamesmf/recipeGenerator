CHICKEN HARVEST SOUP


1 1/2  sticks butter
3/4  c. flour
2  qts. Milk
10  to 12 chicken bouillon cubes or chicken base
1  c. sliced baby carrots
1  c. sliced celery
1/3  c. diced yellow onion
1  tbsp. white pepper
3  Tbsp. onion powder
1  Tbsp. paprika
1  tsp. red pepper
3  lbs. raw chicken tenders, diced
6  oz. wide egg noodles

      Melt butter in small saucepan.  Add flour and cook on low to create roux.  Add more flour to get the pasty consistency.  Cook just enough to remove the raw flour taste.  Heat milk and bouillon cubes in double boiler until a "skin" of tiny surface bubbles forms on top.  Stir occasionally.  Whip in the roux a little at a time until desired thickness.  If you run out of roux before achieving desired thickness, make more and add accordingly.  This is the time to get the soup texture right.  If you wait to thicken, the soup will be lumpy and the noodles broken.  Remove from heat after thickening.  Move to another burner and add vegetables, spices and chicken.  Stir well.  Add raw noodles last.  Cook on low for 10 minutes, then turn off stove.  Let soup sit for 30 minutes as chicken and noodles finish cooking.  Stir gently with a wide spatula to avoid breaking the noodles.  If the starch in the noodles renders the soup too thick, thin with milk or half-and-half.  Reheat and serve with hot yeast rolls.  Recipe can be halved.
