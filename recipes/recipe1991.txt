NATILLAS
(Soft Custard)  

4  eggs, separated
1/4  c. flour
4  c. milk
3/4  c. sugar
1/8  tsp. salt
  nutmeg
  cinnamon

      Place egg yolks, flour and 1 cup of milk in a small mixing bowl.  Stir to make a smooth paste.  Set aside.  Place the remaining milk, sugar and salt in a medium sized saucepan and scald at medium heat.  Add the egg mixture to the scalded milk and continue to cook at medium heat until a soft custard consistency is reached.  Remove custard from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.  Beat the egg whites in a medium sized mixing bowl until they are stiff, but not dry.  Fold the egg whites into the custard.  Chill and garnish with nutmeg and cinnamon before serving.
