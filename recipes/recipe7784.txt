PARMESAN PORK AND PENNE IN TOMATO SAUCE


8  oz. (2 1/2 c.) uncooked penne pasta
2  Tbsp. plain bread crumbs
2  Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese
1  (3/4 lb.) pork tenderloin, sliced
2  tsp. olive oil
1 (14 1/2 oz.)  can diced tomatoes with garlic, oregano and basil (undrained)
1  (8 oz.) tomato sauce
1/2  c. sliced green onions
1 (2 1/2 oz.)  can sliced ripe olives, drained

      Cook penne to desired doneness on package; drain. Combine bread crumbs and cheese in plastic bag. Add pork. Shake to coat. In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add pork; cook 4 to 6 minutes until brown on each side. Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, onion and oil to pork. Stir gently to mix. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer 5 to 10 minutes until pork is tender, stirring occasionally. Serve pork over penne.
