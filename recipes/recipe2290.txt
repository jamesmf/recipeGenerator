HICKORY SMOKED PULLED PORK


3  lb. loin pork roast
1 1/2  c. distilled white vinegar
1/2  c. water
1  Tbsp. Tabasco sauce
2  tsp. yellow mustard (I use spicy)
2  tsp. salt

      Prepare gas grill, turn half of grill on high, leaving the other half off.  Add water soaked hickory chips to side that is turned on.  Place roast on side that is off.  Grill, covered, until fork slips easily into meat.  Cook slowly so meat does not burn on outside.  When meat is cool enough to handle, shred meat and place in bowl.  Meanwhile, stir together vinegar, water, hot sauce, mustard and salt in small bowl.  Add sauce to meat when ready to eat on buns.
