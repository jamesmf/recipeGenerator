HONEY BASERLECKERLI


2  c. sugar
3  Tbsp. butter
2  eggs
2  egg yolks (save the whites)
2  Tbsp. molasses and white corn syrup to equal 1 c.
1/2  tsp. lemon juice
2  c. flour
2  tsp. baking powder
2  tsp. cinnamon
1  tsp. cloves
2 1/2 to 3  c. flour
1 1/2 to 2  c. walnuts

      Cream sugar and butter.  Add eggs and egg yolks, molasses, white corn syrup and lemon juice.  Sift together flour, baking powder, cinnamon and cloves.  Add to mixture by hand (spoon).  By hand, add flour and walnuts.  Cover with aluminum foil and grease 1 jellyroll pan and 1 regular cookie sheet.  Dump dough on sheet and use floured hands to pat dough out 1/2-inch thick.  Bake at 300 degrees; for 25 to 30 minutes.  Toothpick test clean.  These will be chewy if not overbaked.  Cool in a pan for 3 to 4 minutes, then flop out onto wax paper and cool for 5 to 6 minutes, then peel off foil. Cut into bars 1 1/2 to 2-inches square.
Icing:
2  egg whites, beaten
2  c. powdered sugar, sifted
1  tsp. lemon extract

      Ice each cookie individually and let dry before storing.  These are better if made ahead of time.  They also freeze well.  Makes about 6 dozen.
