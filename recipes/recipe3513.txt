NAMAK PAARAY


2  cups flour
1 1/2  Tbsp. shortening, divided
1  tsp. kalongee
3/4  tsp. salt

      Mix together all ingredients and add small amounts of water, enough to make a smooth, binding dough.  Divide dough into 3 parts.  Set aside for 10-15 minutes.
      Roll out each piece of dough into a 1/2-inch thick circle. Spread 1/2 Tbsp. of the shortening on each circle.  Fold the bottom of each circle halfway up towards the center.  Now fold the top of each circle towards the center, overlapping the bottom half.  Fold in the left side towards the middle of what should now be a rectangle.  Then fold in the right side towards the middle, overlapping the left side.  Each piece of dough should now resemble a square.  Cover and set aside for half an hour.
      Working with one piece of dough at a time, on a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thickness.  Using a sharp knife, cut into squares or diamonds.  Deep-fry in hot oil, over medium-low heat until golden-brown.  Drain on paper towels. Repeat procedure for remaining 2 pieces of dough.
      Let cool completely before storing in an air-tight container or zip-locked bag.
