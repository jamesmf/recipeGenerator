CREOLE BLACK-EYED PEAS


2  c. dried black-eyed peas
3  c. chicken broth
2  c. crushed tomatoes, packed in puree
1  large onion, finely chopped
2  stalks celery, finely chopped
3  tsp. finely minced garlic
1/2  tsp. dry mustard
1/4  tsp. ground cumin
1/4  tsp. ground ginger
1/4  tsp. cayenne
1  bay leaf
  salt to taste

      Place the peas in a medium-sized saucepan.  Cover with 2 cups broth; bring to a boil for 2 minutes.  Cover; remove from heat and allow to soak for 1 hour.  Drain and discard the soaking liquid. Add the remaining ingredients to the pan, including the remaining 1 cup chicken broth.  Bring to a boil, cover again, reduce heat and simmer slowly for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.  Add water as necessary to keep the peas covered with liquid.  Remove the bay leaf.  Place in a serving bowl and serve hot, garnished with parsley.
