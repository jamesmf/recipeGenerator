KAREN'S CHICKEN POT PIE


1  large pie crust (homemade or bought)
1  cooked and deboned chicken
  broth from chicken
3  cans cream of chicken soup
1 or 2 small  cans green peas
4  to 5 medium potatoes, pre-cooked
2  cans of crescent rolls
  salt and pepper to taste

      Grease a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish.  Press pie crust to conform to bottom of casserole dish.  Break chicken into small pieces and place on crust.  Mix soup with broth from chicken (as much broth as you need to get soupy consistency).  Add peas and potatoes to mixture; pour over chicken.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Take crescent rolls out of cans and slice roll into 1 inch strips.  Unroll strips and place in a criss-cross pattern over pie filling.  Bake at 350 to 400 degrees; for 40 to 45 minutes.  Cover lightly with foil if needed.
