      Clean and wash chicken pieces.  Pat dry.  Marinate the chicken in all the "marinade" ingredients and refrigerate overnight.
      The next day, prepare batter by adding the dry ingredients to the beaten egg. Mix well with a wire whisk until no lumps remain. If batter seems too thick, add a bit of water to it.  DO NOT make the batter too thin.  It should be a bit thicker than the consistency of a pancake batter.
       Pour batter into the marinated chicken and mix well. Let stand for 1 hour.  Heat oil and deep-fry all the chicken pieces. Keep aside.
      In a wok or large pan heat oil over medium heat and add curry leaves and slit green chillies.  Let it sputter a bit and turn off heat.  Beat the  yogurt with the remaining ingredients and add to the tempered ingredients.  Now, add the chicken pieces.  Turn on heat to medium-high and stir-fry the chicken until yogurt is dried up.  Sprinkle with msg and chopped cilantro leaves. Enjoy!
