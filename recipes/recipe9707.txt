STEAK AND VEGETABLE KABOBS


2  Tbsp. ketchup
1/2  c. canola oil
1/3  c. red wine vinegar
2  to 3 cloves, minced
1  tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1/2  tsp. crushed rosemary (dried)
1/2  tsp. dried marjoram
1/2  tsp. dried basil
1/2  tsp. dried oregano
1 1/2  lb. boneless beef sirloin steak
1/2  lb. whole fresh mushrooms
1 1/2  c. cherry tomatoes
2  medium onions, cut into wedges
2  small bell peppers, cut into 1-inch pieces

      In large resealable bag, combine ketchup, oil, vinegar, seasonings and Worcestershire sauce; set aside. Cut steak into 1-inch cubes (trim fat off if necessary). Add meat and vegetables to ketchup marinade. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate overnight.
       Drain and discard marinade. Alternate beef and vegetables onto metal or soaked wooden skewers. Grill, covered, over medium heat or broil 4 to 6-inches from heat for 6 to 8 minutes. Turn kabobs; cook 4 to 6 minutes longer or until beef reaches desired doneness. Yields 6 servings.
