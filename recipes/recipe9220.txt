HAM STEAK OVEN DISH


1  ham steak, 1 to 2 lb.
3  or 4 baking apples
1  can (8 oz.) whole cranberry sauce
1/4  c. packed brown sugar for sauce
1/4  c. packed brown sugar for apples
1/4  c. juice (pineapple, orange or apple)
2  Tbsp. butter

      Trim ends and fat from ham steak; cut into serving size pieces.  Place ham steak in 9 x 13 x 2 inch baking dish or sheet pan.  For easier clean-up, line with aluminum foil.  Core apples and cut into halves.  Mix brown sugar and butter for apples; fill openings and place at ends of the pan.  In a small saucepan mix cranberry sauce, brown sugar for sauce, and juice together.  Heat until boiling; reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Pour hot sauce over ham and apples.  Bake in 350 degrees; oven for 45 minutes, turning apples and ham once and spooning sauce over them. Transfer to platter or serve from pan.  The sauce can be served as a side dish, if desired.
      Note: Peel and cut sweet potatoes into 3 or 5 diagonal slices and place them along the side of the pan with the apples, if desired.  Also, peeled and halved acorn squash can be used.  Fill cavity with brown sugar and butter.
