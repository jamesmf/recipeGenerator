GRILLED CHICKEN SALAD


1/4  c. grape seed oil or olive oil
3  Tbsp. balsamic vinegar
1  Tbsp. dried dill weed
1 large  clove garlic, minced
1/4  tsp. freshly ground black pepper
1/4  tsp. dried oregano, crushed
4  medium skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
  Montreal or Kansas City steak seasoning
8  c. mesclun or spring salad greens or spinach
3/4  c. seedless red grapes, halved
1/3  c. crumbled goat cheese
1/4  c. pine nuts, toasted

      For vinaigrette, in a screw-top jar, combine oil, vinegar, dill weed, garlic, pepper and oregano. Cover and shake well. Let stand 1 hour.
      Meanwhile, sprinkle chicken breast halves lightly with steak seasoning. Grill chicken on the rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium coals for 12 to 15 minutes or until tender and no longer pink (170 degrees;), turning once. Cool slightly.
      Arrange salad greens on 4 plates. Top with grapes, goat cheese and pine nuts. Slice each chicken breast and arrange one sliced breast on each salad. Shake dressing and drizzle over the salads. Makes 4 servings.
