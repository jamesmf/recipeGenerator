BARBECUE SAUCE FROM SCRATCH


24  large ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped
2  large onions, chopped
2  c. celery, chopped
1  c. chopped green pepper
1  c. chopped red pepper
2  hot peppers, cut up
1  tsp. peppercorns
1 1/2  c. or more of onions
1  c. brown sugar, packed
1  c. vinegar
2  garlic cloves, crushed
1  Tbsp. salt
1  Tbsp. dry mustard
1  Tbsp. paprika
1  tsp. Tabasco sauce
1  tsp. cayenne pepper

      After all vegetables are chopped, put in a large pot and cook until all the veggies are soft, about 30 minutes.  Press through a sieve or food mill.  Put back on stove and cook until mixture is reduced to about 1/2, or about 45 minutes.  Add with the sieved mixture the remaining ingredients, and let cook.  Tie peppercorns in a cheesecloth and drop in the mixture to cook.  After all ingredients are together, they should cook about 1 1/2 hours.  Stir frequently to keep from sticking.  When of desired thickness, pour hot, into sterilized jars and seal.  Process pints 20 minutes in boiling water bath.  Yield:  4 to 5 pints.  (To use, add 1 cup salad oil to 1 pint and mix thoroughly.)
