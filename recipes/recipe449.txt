MINI PIZZAS


1  c. chili sauce
4  English muffins, split into halves, toasted
  Italian seasoning
4  oz. grated Mozzarella
12  slices pepperoni
2  Tbsp. grated Parmesan

      Spread chili sauce on each muffin half.  Sprinkle each with the ingredients in order:  Italian seasoning, Mozzarella, pepperoni and Parmesan.  Place 4 pizzas in microwave at one time on paper towel. Microwave on Medium (60% power) for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or until cheese melts.  Do not overcook or the muffins will get tough.  Do not try to cook all of the pizzas at once because they will not cook evenly.  Makes 8 mini pizzas.
