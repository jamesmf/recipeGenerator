EGG CASSEROLE


1/2  c. onions, finely chopped
1  Tbsp. butter
2  c. cooked ham, cubed
3  eggs, slightly beaten
1  c. sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded
2/3  c. crushed crackers (1/4 lb. Saltines = 2 cups crushed)
1-1/2  c. milk
  Salt to taste (remember crackers have salt on them)
  Pepper to taste

      Cook onions in butter until tender.  Combine all ingredients into casserole and bake at 350 degrees; for 45 - 50 minutes until a knife inserted in center comes out clean.  (I usually double this recipe and put in a 9 x 13 pan.)
