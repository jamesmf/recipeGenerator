BELGIUM CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES


1  c. butter (2 sticks; see note)
1 1/2  c. firmly packed brown sugar
1/2  c. granulated sugar
1  tsp. vanilla
2  eggs
3  c. all-purpose flour, divided
1  tsp. kosher salt
1/4  tsp. ground cinnamon
1  tsp. baking soda
2  c. Belgian chocolate chips, Ghirardelli chips or other high-quality chocolate chips or chunks (12 oz.)
1  c. toasted chopped pecans

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Combine butter and sugars and beat on a medium speed of electric mixer until soft and well incorporated. Add vanilla.  Add eggs.  Add 1 cup flour.  Mix together salt, cinnamon, baking soda and remaining 2 cups flour and add to batter. Add chips and nuts and mix until incorporated.  Using a spoon or a portion scoop, scoop out batter and roll into balls 1 to 1 1/2-inches in diameter.  Place on baking sheet and press down slightly to flatten so each looks like a small hockey puck, about 2 1/2-inches in diameter.  Bake 10 minutes, no longer; they continue to cook once you pull them out of the oven.
      To bake later:  Form the dough into balls.  Place in plastic freezer bags and freeze.  Defrost and bake for 10 minutes in a 350 degrees; oven.  Makes up to 3 dozen.
      Note:  Use real butter or stick margarine.  Do not substitute reduced-fat spreads; their higher water content often yields less-satisfactory results.
      Note:  To toast nuts, spread on baking sheet and bake in 375 degrees; oven for 5 to 8 minutes or until brown.
