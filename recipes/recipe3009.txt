SAUSAGE, CHEESE & SAUERKRAUT BALLS


2  lb. sage sausage - any kind
2  c. quick baking biscuit mix
4  c. shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1  c. finely chopped onion - sometimes use a little more
1  c. finely chopped celery
3  c. sauerkraut, drained
1/2  tsp. garlic powder

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Mix all ingredients together in a very large bowl; making sure sauerkraut is mixed in very well.  Form into balls and place on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake around 20 minutes or until balls are golden brown. Some ovens take longer. You can freeze uncooked balls if you wish.  One recipe makes a lot.  32 ounces of sauerkraut = about 6 cups.
