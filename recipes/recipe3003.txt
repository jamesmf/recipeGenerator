COLD PIZZA
(Appetizer)  

1 (8 oz.)  pkg. cream cheese, softened
1/2  bottle chili sauce (Bennett brand other brands change the taste)
1/2  c. green pepper, chopped
1/2  c. onion, chopped
1  pkg. each of white and yellow cheese, shredded

      Mix cream cheese, onion, green pepper and spread evenly over bottom of a square dish or small oblong pan (8 x 4 inch).  Spread chili sauce as second layer.  Sprinkle cheese on top.  Serve with large size Fritos.  Since this recipe makes only a small amount, I usually double the recipe.
