ITALIAN SAUSAGE MEAL


  Italian sausage (6 in a pack)
  onions, chopped
  peppers, diced (green, yellow and/or orange)
1  can petite cut tomatoes, diced
  ketchup (according to taste)
  noodles

	Cut sausage in bite sizes. Brown in a little oil. Add onions and peppers. Add tomatoes, then add some ketchup (guess the amount; this seems to sweeten it some). While all this is simmering, cook noodles and add to sausage mixture and heat through.
