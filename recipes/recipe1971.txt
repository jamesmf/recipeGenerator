Beat in 1 egg at a time.  Add vanilla; continue beating until mixture is smooth.  Press mixture through fluted tip cookie press with 1/2-inch wide opening.  Cut into 2-inch strips with wet scissors.  Drop into 350 degrees; fat.  Fry several at a time for 2 minutes on each side.  Drain well.  Roll in cinnamon mixture or sugar mixture.  Yields 2 1/2 dozen.
