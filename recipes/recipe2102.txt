SOFT CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES FANTASY


1/2  c. heavy cream
1/4  c. butter
1/2  lb. semi-sweet chocolate chips
  pinch of salt
1  tsp. vanilla
2  egg yolks
1  c. sifted powdered sugar
1  Tbsp. Grand Marnier liqueur
1/2 to 3/4  c. finely chopped nuts

      In top double boiler, heat cream with butter until butter is melted.  Add chocolate chips, salt and vanilla; stir until chocolate is melted.  Remove from heat and beat in the yolks until blended.  Add sugar and Grand Marnier and beat until smooth, about 1 minute.  Line an 8 x 12-inch pan with plastic wrap extended about 4-inches over the sides.  Spread chocolate evenly in prepared pan and refrigerate until firm.  Cut into 1-inch squares and sprinkle top with sifted cocoa.  Remove each square and dust with cocoa on each side.  Place in bonbon wrappers and refrigerate until ready to serve.  Yields 96 (1-inch) squares.  Delicious!
