1  lb. ground beef
1  lb. Jimmy Dean Sausage (Hot or Mild)
20  oz. canned tomatoes
8  oz. tomato sauce

      Brown and drain ground beef and sausage. Add next 7 ingredients and cook together until it looks like spaghetti sauce. In a 17x 9 inch pan, layer in this order, noodles, meat sauce, cottage cheese, mozzarella. Layer again the same way, but end with a layer of meat sauce on top. Cover with heavy foil and bake at 300 degrees for 1 hour. Remove foil and cook 1/2 hour. Let set 10-15 minutes before cutting.
