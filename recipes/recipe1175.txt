APPLE PIE


  crust for 2 crust (8-inch) pie
1  can Comstock sliced apples (do not use pie filling)
12  packets Equal sugar substitute
2  Tbsp. all-purpose flour
1  Tbsp. brown sugar (optional)
1/2  tsp. cinnamon
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. nutmeg
2  tsp. lemon juice
2  Tbsp. butter
1 or 1 1/2  oz. dry cream
  sherry (optional)

      In a large size mixing bowl, thoroughly combine all ingredients except butter.  Do not drain liquid from apples.  It is necessary for juice.  (Mix all filling ingredients and let them marinate while preparing pie crust.)  Turn apples into pastry lined pie plate, dot with butter and cover with top crust.  Make slits to allow steam to escape, seal and flute edges of crust.  Bake in 425 degrees; oven for 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown.
