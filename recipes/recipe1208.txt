ICEBOX COOKIES


1  c. Crisco or oleo
7  tsp. powdered sweetener
3  Tbsp. milk (may take a little more)
1  tsp. almond
1  tsp. vanilla
2  eggs, beaten
2  c. flour
1/2  tsp. baking powder
1/2  c. chopped pecans or walnuts

      Mix Crisco or oleo, powdered sweetener, milk, almond, vanilla and eggs together and add flour, baking powder and nuts.  Make into logs and refrigerate overnight.  Slice and bake at 350 degrees; until light brown.  They do not brown like cookies with sugar.  Can also add coconut and substitute unsweetened orange juice for the milk.  Keep in refrigerator.
