LYNDA'S "BLUE RIBBON" CORN BREAD


1  egg
1  c. plus 2 Tbsp. milk
1/2  c. flour
1  c. yellow corn meal
3  tsp. baking powder
1  tsp. salt
3  Tbsp. soft shortening (bacon fat adds flavor)
5 or 6  c. crumbled cornbread
1 to 1 1/2  c. chopped onion
1  c. chopped celery
5  or 6 eggs (depending on size)
  salt, pepper and poultry seasoning
2 or 3  c. crumbled biscuits or loaf bread (stale or leftover)
4  c. chicken broth
1 1/2  tsp. prepared mustard

      Place crumbled cornbread and bread in large bowl and sprinkle lightly with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning.  Pour approximately 2 to 2 1/2 cups hot broth over this mixture.  Let stand about 30 minutes or until you can "smush" it between your fingers.  Saut√© chopped onions and celery in 1/2 cup broth until soft.  Add this to cornbread mixture.  Break eggs and beat, one at a time, and add to mixture.  Add remaining broth and mustard.  Beat well with spoon or fork.  Dressing should be fairly thin.  If too dry, you might add a little water or broth.  Place in baking dish and bake at 300 degrees; to 325 degrees; for about an hour.  Check at about 45 minutes and if it is getting too dry, you might cover it loosely with aluminum foil for the remainder of cooking time.  Serve with Giblet Gravy.
