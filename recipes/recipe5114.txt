GUMBO


1  c. oil
1  chicken, cut up or boned
1 1/2  lb. andouille
1  c. flour
4  c. chopped onions
2  c. chopped celery
2  c. chopped green pepper
1  Tbsp. chopped garlic
8  c. stock or flavored water
2  c. chopped green onions
  cooked rice
  Joe's Stuff seasoning

      Season and brown chicken in oil over medium heat. Add sausage to pot and saut with chicken. Remove both from pot. Make a roux with equal parts of oil (must be free of food particles to avoid burning) and flour to desired color. Add onions, celery and green peppers. Add garlic to the mixture and stir continuously. After vegetables reach desired tenderness, return chicken and sausage to pot and cook with vegetables, continuing to stir frequently. Gradually stir in liquid; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and cook for an hour or more. Season to taste with Joe's Stuff seasoning. Ten minutes before serving, add green onions. Serve gumbo over rice or without rice. Serve with French bread.
