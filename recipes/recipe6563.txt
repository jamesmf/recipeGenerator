ENCHILADAS


1  whole chicken or 1 roast beef
24  corn tortillas
2  lb. Mexican mix cheese
1 small  can diced green chiles
1/2  onion, diced
1  tsp. chili powder
1 large  can red enchilada sauce (Macayo or Las Palmas brand)
  oil
1 small  can sliced black olives

      Chicken or beef must be cooked all day in crock-pot and then remove all fat and bones.  Pull apart meat into shreds.  Add 1 teaspoon of chili powder to meat and mix thoroughly.  Heat up enough oil in a frying pan and fry each tortilla on each side for about 10 seconds.  Drain on paper towels.  You will have to add more oil as you go.  Pour a thin layer of your enchilada sauce into a 9 x 12 baking dish.  Place approximately 2 tablespoons of chicken on the edge of tortilla and then put cheese on top of meat and roll up tortilla.  Place in baking dish.  Do this until all tortillas are rolled up.  Pour the rest of the enchilada sauce over the rolled tortillas, then top with cheese, onions, olives and green chiles.  Bake at 375 degrees; for 35 to 45 minutes.  Makes 4 to 6 servings.
