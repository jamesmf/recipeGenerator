ROASTED GAME HENS WITH POTATO HASH


2  Tbsp. olive oil, divided
1/2  red bell pepper, diced
1/2  red onion, thinly sliced
2  ribs celery, sliced
1 1/2  tsp. paprika, divided
1 1/2  tsp. minced thyme leaves or 1/2 tsp. dried thyme
1/4  c. minced parsley, divided
1/2  tsp. salt
  black pepper, freshly ground
1  large russet potato, cut into 1/2 inch cubes, patted dry
1  c. chicken or vegetable broth
2 game hens, about 1  lb. each

      Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  To make hash, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a heavy skillet over high heat; add bell pepper, onion and celery.  Stirring often.  Cook until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add 1/2 teaspoon paprika, thyme, 2 tablespoons parsley, and salt and black pepper to taste.  Stir in potato.  Add broth; heat to boiling.  Lower heat to a simmer; partially cover pan.  Cook, turning occasionally, until potato is tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, but keep warm till ready to serve.  Meanwhile, cut backbone from each hen with a knife or kitchen shears.  Rub hens all over with remaining 1 tablespoon oil; season with remaining 1 teaspoon paprika, and salt and black pepper, to taste. Heat an ovenproof skillet over high heat; brown hens, skin side up, 3 minutes.  Turn; brown 2 minutes more.  Transfer pan to oven; place another cast-iron pan or a brick wrapped with foil on top of hens.  Roast 12 minutes. Remove top pan or brick.  Turn birds skin side up; cook until firm, evenly brown, but still moist, about 7 minutes.  Mound hash on each of 2 plates; place a hen on each. Garnish with remaining 2 tablespoons parsley.  Makes 2 servings.
