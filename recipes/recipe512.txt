BUTTER COOKIES


1  c. softened butter or margarine
2/3  c. sugar
2 1/2  c. flour
1  tsp. vanilla

      Beat butter and sugar until creamy.  Add flour and vanilla. Dough should be soft, but not stiff (should be able to hold in your hand without it sticking).  If too stiff, add a tablespoon of milk. Make balls about the size of a walnut.  Place on cookie sheet and flatten with fingers or bottom of a glass dipped in sugar.  Bake at 350 degrees; until slightly brown.  Makes about 2 dozen cookies.
