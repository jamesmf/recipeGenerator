BIRMING


1  (6 to 7 lb.) cooked corned beef roast
1 (10 oz.)  jar red maraschino cherries (undrained)
1  c. firmly packed brown sugar
1/2  c. orange juice
1/2  tsp. whole cloves
1  medium orange, sliced

      Place beef roast in a lightly greased 13 x 9 x 2-inch pan and cover.  Bake at 325 degrees; for 30 minutes.  Drain cherries, reserving syrup.  Set cherries aside.  Combine cherry syrup, brown sugar, orange juice and cloves in a saucepan; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Set aside.  Make shallow cuts in roast in diamond shape designs and brush with cherry mixture.  Secure orange slices and cherries on roast with wooden picks.  Brush fruit with cherry mixture.  Cover and bake 30 minutes, brushing every 10 minutes with remaining cherry mixture. Yield:  10 to 12 servings.
