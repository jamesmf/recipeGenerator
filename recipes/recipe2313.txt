POTATO SKINS


1  small bag baking potatoes
1  c. shredded Cheddar cheese
1  c. shredded Mozzarella cheese
1/2  c. shredded Swiss cheese
1/4  c. Parmesan cheese
1  pkg. bacon
  salt and pepper
3  c. oil (enough to deep fry skins)

      Bake potatoes.  Cut them in half and scoop out the meat.  The more meat you scoop out, the crispier the skins will be.  (The meat can be used for mashed potatoes.)  Cook bacon until crisp and crumble.  Mix all cheeses together.  Heat oil and drop in skins, turning occasionally.  When skins are light brown, remove and drain on a paper towel.  Place skins on a baking sheet.  Season with salt and pepper.  Fill with cheeses and bacon.  Broil until cheeses melt.  Serve with Ranch dressing, sour cream or your favorite dip.
