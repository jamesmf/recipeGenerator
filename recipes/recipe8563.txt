CHICKEN CASSEROLE


4  chicken breasts, cooked and cut in small pieces
2  stacks Ritz crackers
1  stick Oleo
1  carton Sour Cream
1  can Cream of Chicken Soup
1  can Cream of Mushroom Soup

      Line a 13x9 inch pyrex dish with whole crackers. Cut up 1/2 stick of oleo and place on top.  Layer chicken next.  Mix sour cream and soups and pour over chicken.  Crush 1 stack of Ritz crackers (more if needed). Sprinkle over casserole. Cut up 1/2 stick of Oleo and place over the top of crackers. Bake 30 to 45 minutes at 350 degrees until bubbly. This casserole is even better if refrigerated over night.
