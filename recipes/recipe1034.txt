SAUSAGE STEW



1 1/2 to 2  lb. smoked sausage
4  or 5 potatoes
1  or 2 medium onions
2 to 3  Tbsp. paprika
  salt to taste
  dumplings (recipe follows)

      In large pot put thin sliced sausage, sliced potatoes and onions.  Cover with at least 1 inch water and paprika.  Salt to taste.  While this is cooking, make dumplings.
Dumplings:
3  c. flour
3  whole eggs
  salt and pepper to taste
  milk

      Combine flour, eggs, salt and pepper.  Add milk until tacky and wet.  When stew is boiling, add dumpling mixture by teaspoonfuls. Cook until dumplings are done.  Let stand with lid on 10 minutes before serving.  It's even better the next day.
