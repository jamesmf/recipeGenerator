RICE PUDDING


1 1/4  c. milk
1 1/4  c. water
1/4  c. sugar
1  c. uncooked rice
2  Tbsp. soft butter or margarine
1/2  tsp. vanilla flavoring
1  c. whipping cream
1  Tbsp. sugar
  fresh strawberries (or frozen with sauce)

      In a large saucepan, combine milk, water and the 1/4 cup sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat.  Stir in rice.  Reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, about 30 to 35 minutes or until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed.  Remove from heat.  Stir in butter and vanilla flavoring until well combined.  Cool.  Whip the whipping cream.  Beat in 1 tablespoon sugar.  Fold cream into pudding. Cover and chill at least 2 hours before serving.  Serve with strawberries and strawberry sauce.
