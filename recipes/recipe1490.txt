GRILLED EGGPLANT



1/2  c. olive oil
1/4  c. red wine vinegar
1/2  lemon (for the juice)
2  cloves garlic, crushed
1  Tbsp. chopped rosemary leaves
1  Tbsp. chopped oregano leaves
1  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. ground pepper
2  small or 1 large eggplant, cut into 1-inch thick pieces

      Combine all the ingredients for the marinade.  Place in a flat-bottomed pan, such as a 9 x 13-inch cake pan.  Place the eggplant slices in the pan.  Allow the slices to soak on each side for at least 10 minutes per side.  Grill over hot coals until soft. Occasionally drizzle with the marinade.  When eggplant is very tender, serve immediately.  Serves 4.
