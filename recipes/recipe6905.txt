ROAST (PORK OR BEEF)


1  beef or pork roast
1  onion, chopped fine
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper
  Tony's
1/2 to 1  tsp. minced garlic (depends on size of roast)
1  to 2 potatoes, quartered (if wanted)

	Add your seasoned roast to pot and brown. It will make water so don't add any now. Once the water cooks out and the roast browns real good on both sides, add onions and smother down (don't worry, they will brown too). Add small amounts of water (about 1 cup) at a time until tender. Cook on medium to low heat until done. Add potatoes when you see the roast is tender and cook until they are done.
	 If you are cooking a pork roast, don't use onions, but fry down the same way. You can also stuff your roast (pork) with garlic. Just make a hole with a knife and push the garlic in.
