CORN ON THE COB

Leather Britches:

      Take good, fresh green beans.  Remove the ends and strings. Thread a needle with strong thread and string whole beans together. Hang them in a dry location, sunny if possible, but not in direct sun.  Don't leave them out overnight.  Dew will collect on them and they won't dry properly.
      Once they are completely dry, hang them in a cool, dry place. Mama used to put leather britches in a flour sack or pillow case, then tie a knot in the end and hang them up in the hall.
      When ready to cook leather britches, wash them, cover with water in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil.  Season with salt pork or bacon drippings, lower heat and simmer 2 to 3 hours.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
