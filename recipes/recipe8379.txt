RIBS


2  lb. pork spareribs or baby back ribs
1  c. tomato sauce
3/4  c. steak sauce
1/2  c. sorghum
1/4  c. ketchup
1/4  c. lemon juice
2  Tbsp. brown sugar
2  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
2  to 4 dashes Tabasco sauce

      Combine tomato sauce, steak sauce, sorghum, ketchup, lemon juice, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco sauce in a medium saucepan.  Stir over low heat until thoroughly heated, about 10 minutes.  Place ribs on grill over medium heat.  Baste with sauce.  Cook 45 to 60 minutes, basting and turning ribs every 10 to 15 minutes.  The ribs are done when the internal temperature reaches 180 degrees;, when the ribs are flexible and fork tender and when the ends of the bones extend about 1/2-inch beyond the meat.  Ribs may also be basted and baked in a 350 degrees; oven for 1 hour or until done.
