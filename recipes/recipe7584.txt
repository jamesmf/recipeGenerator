ITALIAN CHICKEN DIANE


6  boneless chicken breasts
2  eggs
1 1/2  c. milk
  Italian seasoning
  Flour
  Cooking oil
  Spaghetti sauce
  Mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced

      Put more than enough flour in a bowl to coat the chicken breasts.  Mix approx. 2 tsp. Italian seasoning into flour.  In a separate bowl mix the eggs and milk together.  Pour about 1-inch of cooking oil in a skillet and heat to Medium-High.  Dip the chicken breast in the egg wash, press gently in seasoned flour mixture, dip again in egg wash and one last time in flour mixture.  Place in hot grease.  Once the chicken is very brown on both sides, turn down temperature and simmer approx. 10 min.  Remove chicken from skillet and drain on paper towels (nobody likes greasy chicken). In the bottom of a 9x18 casserole dish spread a thin layer of spaghetti sauce.  Place chicken breasts in casserole dish and cover 1/2 to 3/4 up with spaghetti sauce.  Place the mozzarella cheese on top of the chicken and place a little spaghetti sauce on the cheese.  Bake covered 45-50 min. on 375 degrees;.
