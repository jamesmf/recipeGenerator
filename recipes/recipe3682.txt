16  - 20 cherry tomatoes
1  lb. bacon, chopped and cooked, drain well
1/2  c. mayonnaise
1/3  c. chopped green onions
3  Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese
2  Tbsp. snipped fresh parsley

      Cut a thin slice off each tomato top. Scoop out and discard pulp. Invert the tomatoes on a paper towel to drain. In a bowl, combine all remaining ingredients; mix well. Spoon into tomatoes. Refrigerate for several hours. Serve at parties, brunches and picnics. Always a hit.
