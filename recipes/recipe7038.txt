GREEN CHILI ENCHILADAS


  cooking oil
1 small  can green chili peppers, chopped
1 small  can evaporated milk
1  can cream of mushroom soup
1/2  c. water
12  corn tortillas
  grated cheese
  chopped onion

      In skillet, heat oil. In a sauce pan, mix green chili peppers, milk, soups, and water. Dip tortillas into hot oil just long enough to get them hot; dip tortilla in soup mixture. Remove tortillas and place a small amount of onions and cheese on each one. Roll up each tortilla and place in a baking dish. Pour rest of soup mixture over; add more onions and cheese. Cover with foil and bake 30 minutes at 350 degrees; or until onions are cooked and cheese is melted. If desired, you can brown ground meat and use inside tortilla and sprinkle on top.
