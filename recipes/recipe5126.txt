BEAN SOUP


1 (16 oz.)  pkg. dry Great Northern beans
4 to 6  c. water (for soaking beans)
1  ham bone
1  c. smoked sausage, cut up
1  diced onion
3/4  c. water
1/2  c. celery, diced
1  c. carrots, sliced
1  large potato, diced
1 (28 oz.)  can crushed tomatoes
  black pepper and hot pepper sauce (optional)

      Rinse and soak beans overnight in 4 to 6 cups water, changing water once or twice. In a large pot or Dutch oven, place ham bone, sausage, onion, celery and 3 to 4 cups water. Simmer for a couple of hours. Remove from stove and refrigerate overnight.
      Next day, return soup to stove after removing most of fat which rises to top. Heat on medium-low and remove ham bone, leaving as much ham in pot as desired. Add tomatoes, carrots and additional water, if needed. Add potatoes. Increase heat to medium and cook for 1 hour. Drain and rinse beans and add to soup. Simmer for 2 hours. Season with black pepper, salt and hot sauce as desired. Cooking time: 4 to 5 hours. Makes 12 servings.
