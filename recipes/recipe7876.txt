MALAI MURGHY


1  chicken, cut into pieces
1  tsp. each, garlic and ginger paste
1  tsp. green chili paste
1-1/4  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. black pepper powder
1  tsp. cumin powder
  Breadcrumbs
1  beaten egg
2-3/4  cups milk
1  Tbsp. butter flavored shortening

      Wash and dry chicken pieces thoroughly.  Poke pieces with fork and marinate chicken with garlic, ginger and green chili pastes, salt, pepper, and cumin powder for 2 hours.
      Heat a few cups of oil, enough to deep fry chicken.  Roll the chicken pieces in breadcrumbs then dip in beaten egg.  Place coated pieces in hot oil and fry 3-5 minutes on each side, turning once.  Keep the chicken pieces in a nonstick pot.  After all the chicken is done frying, add milk and shortening to the pot.  Over medium heat, carefully bring the milk to a boil.  Turn chicken pieces once and cover. Turn heat to lowest setting and cook for 30-35 minutes, stirring and scraping sides of pot frequently. When Malai Murghy is done, the milk will have turned creamy and chicken will be very fragrant.
      Serve with warm bread.
