BACON WRAPPED CHICKEN BREAST


  chicken breast
  bacon
  salt and pepper
  garlic powder
  onion powder

      Wash chicken breast; remove excess skin. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder, to taste. (Tony's Chachere's Creole seasoning may be used.) Wrap strips of bacon around each breast, closing with a toothpick. Let set in refrigerator several hours for better flavor. Cook on grill until done. Chicken breasts tend to dry out so do not overcook. Enjoy!
