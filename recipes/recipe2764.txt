SALTED PUMPKIN SEEDS


  seeds from Halloween jack-o'-lanterns
  salt
  water

      Remove seeds from pumpkin and wash off all pulp (you will learn anew the meaning of slippery doing this).  Place seeds in shallow baking pans.  Half cover seeds with saltwater (1 teaspoon salt to 1 cup water).  Place in a 200 degrees; oven and bake until all water has evaporated and seeds are crisp.  Store in airtight container if they last that long.
