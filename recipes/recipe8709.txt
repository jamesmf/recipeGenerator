NOL'S ETOUFFEE


1  c. flour
1  stick butter
1  large bell pepper, chopped
1  large onion, chopped
1  rib celery, chopped
4  cloves garlic, chopped
1  c. chicken broth or 2 cubes chicken bouillon, dissolved in 1 c. water
1  can Ro-Tel tomatoes and green chilies
1  lb. shrimp, cooked and peeled or 1 lb. crawfish tails, peeled

	In a microwave-safe bowl, prepare roux by cooking the flour in the microwave for 2 minutes.  Stir and continue to microwave in 1 minute increments stopping to stir frequently to prevent roux from burning or getting hot spots, continuing this process until the flour turns dark tan. If you burn and get hard black pieces, you can remove with spoon and the rest of the roux will be okay.
	In a large pot, melt the butter and saut√© the bell pepper, onion, celery and garlic.  Add the broth and Ro-Tel. Stir until well blended.  Reduce heat and simmer for 2 to 4 hours.   About 20 to 30 minutes before you are ready to serve, add the shrimp or crawfish and cook until well heated.
