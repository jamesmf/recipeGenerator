PASINDA-E-KHAAS


2  lb. stew beef
1  dozen blanched almonds, finely ground
1  Tbsp. poppy seeds, finely ground
1  tsp. each ginger/garlic
1  tsp. green chili paste
1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper (optional)
1/4  tsp. cinnamon powder
1/2  tsp. clove powder
1/2  tsp. black pepper powder
1  tsp. salt
2  tsp. gram flour (besan)
1/4 - 1/2  pkg. Shan Bihari Kabab Masala
5 to 6  Tbsp. kiwi paste
2  onions, finely sliced
3/4  cup oil
1/4  cup fresh, thick cream
1  cup yogurt
1/4  cup lemon juice

      Cut meat into very thin pasinda-style slices.  Wash and drain well. Fry onions in oil until golden. Drain on paper towels; let cool then crush with the back of a spoon.  Set aside.
      Marinate meat with ground almonds, ground poppy seeds, ginger/garlic, green chili paste, cayenne pepper, cinnamon powder, clove powder, black pepper powder, salt, gram flour, Shan masala, kiwi paste and fried, crushed onions.  Leave to marinate overnight in refrigerator.
      When ready to grill, add the cream, yogurt and lemon juice to the meat and let sit on counter top until it reaches room temperature.  Line a broiler-safe pan or dish with foil and generously oil it. Slide beef slices onto skewers and place them inside the pan.  Pour any remaining marinade over skewers.
       Set oven to broil and pre-heat for 5 minutes.  Place pan in broiler and grill until meat is well browned, rotating skewers at intervals.  Apply oil or butter while rotating.  Meat should be fully tender when done.  Serve hot with parathas or tandoori naans.
