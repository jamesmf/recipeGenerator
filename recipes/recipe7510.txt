CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS


1  broiler-fryer chicken (3 1/2 to 4 lb.), cut up
1 1/2  tsp. salt
2  c. all-purpose flour
2  tsp. baking powder
1  tsp. salt
1/3  c. shortening
1/2  c. milk

      Place chicken pieces in Dutch oven; barely cover with water, add salt and simmer until meat is tender.  Remove skin and bones; set chicken meat aside, reserving the broth.  Stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt; cut in shortening.  Add milk to make a stiff dough.  Roll out to 1/4-inch thickness on floured board.  Cut into 1-inch squares, and sprinkle with flour.  Drop into briskly boiling chicken stock.  Cover tightly and simmer gently for about 40 minutes.  Add meat and serve.  Makes 6 to 8 servings.
