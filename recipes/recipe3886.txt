SPINACH DIP


10  oz. frozen chopped spinach, thawed and all liquid out
1  pkg. Knorr vegetable soup mix (dry)
1  small onion, chopped (small pieces)
1  c. mayonnaise
1  c. sour cream

      Mix all ingredients and chill at least 2 hours before serving.
      Must squeeze all liquid out of spinach. Use hands. If you don't, dip will be runny! Serve with crackers.
