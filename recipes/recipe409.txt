CHOCOLATE SNAKE


1/2  c. peanut butter
1/2  c. dry milk powder
1/2  c. honey
1  Tbsp. cocoa
1/2  tsp. vanilla extract
1/4  c. chopped nuts
1/4  c. raisins
1/4  c. chopped dates
2  Tbsp. shredded coconut

      Combine peanut butter and dry milk powder in mixing bowl.  Stir until thoroughly blended.  Stir in, one at a time, honey, cocoa, vanilla, nuts, raisins, dates and coconut.  Clean hands work well for this.  Put mixture on waxed paper and roll into the shape of a fat snake.  Pull or cut off pieces; they're ready to eat.  Wrap snake in wax paper and store in refrigerator.
