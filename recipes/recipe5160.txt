HOT SALMON SALAD


1  medium onion
1/4  stick margarine
3  c. milk
1/4  lb. soda crackers
1 large  can of salmon
  Salt and pepper to taste
  Sliced hard boiled eggs (optional)

      Melt margarine and brown onion.  Add milk.  Warm, do not boil.  Add crackers (crumbled) and drained salmon.  Takes just a few minutes to cook down.  Watch closely and stir often so that it doesn't burn.  Add hard boiled eggs last.
