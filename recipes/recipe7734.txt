FAVORITE CHICKEN CASSEROLE


3 to 4  lb. hen
3/4  stick butter or margarine
1  pkg. Pepperidge Farm cornbread stuffing
1 (10 oz.)  can cream of mushroom soup
1 (10 oz.)  can cream of chicken soup
1/2  c. broth from hen

      Place hen in saucepan and cover with cold water.  Boil until tender. Remove from saucepan, reserving broth. Pick meat from bone; set aside. Melt butter and pour over stuffing mix. Add enough broth to moisten. Heat together soups and 1/2 cup broth. Place in a buttered 2-quart baking dish, alternating layers of chicken, soups and stuffing crumbs. Do this twice. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees; for 30 to 45 minutes or until bubbly. Serves 6.
