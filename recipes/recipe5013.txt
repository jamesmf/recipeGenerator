OVEN STEW


  Stew beef chunks
  Cut up potatoes
  Sliced carrots
  Sliced celery
  Coarsely chopped onion
  One can of green peas plus liquid
  One can chopped tomatoes
  One can of tomato soup
  One can of water

      Layer the ingredients in the order given, in an ovenproof Dutch oven with a lid, and bake for five (5) hours at 275 degrees;. Sprinkle top with salt and pepper.
      This is excellent served with homemade bread, biscuits, or rolls, and a green salad.  This is one of those recipes that you can make as much or as little of as you like and is just as good reheated as it was fresh out of the oven!
