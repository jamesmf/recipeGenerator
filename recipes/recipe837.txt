About 1 hour before serving, heat about 1 1/2 pints cooking oil in heavy 9-inch saucepan.  Put 2 cups milk or club soda in bowl and dip each piece of chicken in the liquid.  Combine pancake mix, paprika, sage and pepper.  Dust chicken with pancake mix.  Dry pieces a few minutes without letting them touch.  Fry a few pieces at a time 5 to 6 minutes.
