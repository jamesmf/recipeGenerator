      Place salmon on greased rack of broiler pan; squeeze juice from lemon half over fish and broil 5 to 8 minutes; turn and drizzle with more lemon juice.  Continue broiling  5 to 8 minutes or until fish flakes easily with fork; don't overcook.  Meanwhile in a small saucepan melt the butter and whisk the mustard in until well blended; keep warm.
