1  stick unsalted butter
1/2  c. almonds, chopped
1/2  c. yogurt
3/4  c. sugar
1  c. semolina
1  tsp. baking powder
1  tsp. vanilla extract
1  stick unsalted butter, melted
1  c. whipped cream

 
Syrup:
1  c. sugar
1/3  c. water
  juice of 1/2 lemon
1  Tbsp. rose water (optional)

      In a frying pan, melt the butter and fry the almonds in the butter until slightly brown.  Strain the butter to remove the almonds bits.  Set aside.  Keep at room temperature.  In a large mixing bowl, mix the yogurt and sugar until creamy.  In the mixing bowl, combine with the yogurt and sugar mixture the almonds, their frying butter, semolina, baking powder and vanilla extract.  Mix until well blended.  Pour the mixture into a well oiled oven pan, measuring about 9 x 9 x 2-inches.  Bake in a 400 degrees; oven for about 30 minutes.
      Meanwhile, prepare the syrup by stirring the sugar, water and lemon juice over medium heat until thick to the point that it coats the metal spoon.  Add rose water (optional) and cook with stirring for a few more minutes until well mixed.  Remove from heat and cool slightly in the refrigerator.
