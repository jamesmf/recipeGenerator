CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS


1  (2 1/2 to 3 lb.) broiler-fryer chicken, skinned and cut into 8 pieces
1/4  tsp. each salt and black pepper
1  Tbsp. olive oil
2  c. chopped leeks
1 1/2  c. chopped carrots
1/2  c. chopped celery
1/2  tsp. each dried marjoram and thyme
1/4  c. all-purpose flour
5 1/2  c. chicken stock
1/2  c. whole milk
1  tsp. fresh lemon juice
3  Tbsp. minced parsley

 
For The Dumplings:
1 3/4  c. all-purpose flour
1/2  tsp. baking soda
1/4  tsp. salt
3  Tbsp. vegetable shortening
2/3 to 3/4  c. low-fat buttermilk

      Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper.  In a deep, nonstick 12-inch skillet, heat the oil over moderately high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 4 minutes on each side or until browned.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to a plate.  Add the vegetables, marjoram and thyme to the skillet and saut for 5 minutes.  Stir in the flour and cook until bubbly, then stir in the stock and milk.  Add the chicken and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat; cover and simmer for 20 minutes.  Stir in the lemon juice.
      To make the dumplings:  In a medium size bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt.  Using 2 knives, cut in the shortening, then stir in enough buttermilk to form a soft dough. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into an 8 x 8 x 1/2-inch square; cut into sixteen 2-inch squares.  Slide the dumplings into the skillet.  Cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until cooked through.  Top with parsley.  Makes 4 servings.
