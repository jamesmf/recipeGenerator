SHRIMPBALAYA


1/2  stick butter
1/2  c. chopped green pepper
3/4  lb. ground hot sausage
1  lb. chicken, deboned and cubed
12 to 16  oz. shrimp
  milk and flour
  hot cooked noodles
  salt and pepper

      In large skillet, melt butter and saut green pepper and sausage until cooked halfway, then add chicken.  Cook until meats are done.  With slotted spoon, remove the meat from pan, letting the drippings drain back into the pan; set aside.  Add flour to make a thickening, then stir in enough milk to make a thin gravy. Add the shrimp to the skillet along with the meat and any juice it may have.  Cook until the shrimp turn pink, about 10 minutes.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Serve on the noodles.
