LASAGNA PIE


9  to 10 Lasagna Noodles
3  tbsp skim milk
1/4  tsp black pepper
1  1/4 cups coarsely chopped carrot
1  clove garlic minced
1/2  tsp dried crushed oregano
2  small tomatoes, thinly sliced
1  1/2 cups ricotta cheese
1/2  tsp crushed dried basil
1  lb ground turkey
1/2  cup chopped onion
1 - 15 oz  can tomato sauce
1/4  tsp salt

      Cook noodles.  Combine ricotta, milk, basil & pepper and set aside.
      Filling - Cook turkey, carrots, onion & garlic until turkey is brown and carrots tender, drain off fat.  Stir in tomato sauce, oregano & salt, cook until heated.
      Line greased 9 inch spring form pan with the noodles, extending noodles over the sides of the pan.  Layer 1/2 the turkey mixture, 1 cup of ricotta mixture and remaining turkey mixture. Trim noodles so 3 inches extend over top of the turkey mixture. Discard the trimmings.  Fold noodle ends over the turkey mixture. Place on a 15 x 10 x 1 pan and bake for 30 minutes at 375 degrees. Spread the remaining ricotta mixture over top, place tomatoes around edges, cover and bake 20 minutes more until heated through. Let stand 10 minutes.  (Mozzarella cheese can be sprinkled over the ricotta, if you like.)
