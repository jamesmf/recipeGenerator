MUTTON CHOPS


1  lb. lamb chops
1-1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. turmeric
1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper
1  tsp. garlic paste
1  tsp. green chili paste
2  tsp. cumin powder
3  tsp. cilantro paste
2  egg whites
  Oil to deep-fry

      Cook lamb chops in 2-3 cups of water along with turmeric and salt until tender.  While there is still water left in the meat, add garlic paste, cumin powder, cayenne pepper and cilantro paste and cook until the gravy gets soaked and the flavor combines with the meat.
      Let it cool.  Make sure each piece of meat is coated with the gravy.  Dip each piece of meat in beaten egg whites and deep fry until golden brown.
      Garnish with onion, tomatoes and lemons.  Serve hot.
