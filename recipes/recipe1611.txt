BRAZILIAN SWEET BREAD


2  pkg. dry active yeast
1/4  c. warm water
1  c. lukewarm milk
3/4  c. sugar
1  tsp. salt
3  eggs
1/2  c. margarine
1/2  tsp. lemon peel
6  c. bread flour

      Stir the yeast into the warm water.  Set the mixture aside for about 10 minutes.  Mix the flour and salt into a large bowl; make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture, sugar, eggs, milk, butter and lemon peel.  Mix to a smooth dough; then lay the dough on a floured board and knead the dough until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes).  If you need more flour, add slowly until dough does not stick to the hands.  Return dough to the bowl and cover; let rise for 1 hour, until it has doubled in volume. Punch down the dough and braid it or just knead it into a ball. Mold the ball the same length as the bread pan.  Cover the pan and set the dough aside in warm place until it rises above the rim (about 1 hour).  Bake for 35 minutes in a preheated oven (350 degrees;). Let cool down on wire rack.
