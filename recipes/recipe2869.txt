CHRISTMAS COFFEE CAKE


2 1/4  oz. pkg. dry active yeast
1/2  c. warm water
1 1/2  c. butter, softened
1  c. sugar
1  doz. egg yolks
5  c. flour
3/4  tsp. salt
1 1/2  c. scalded milk
1 1/2  c. golden raisins
1  c. slivered almonds
  confectioners sugar

      Dissolve yeast in water.  Cream butter and sugar.  Slowly add egg yolks and beat well.  Add yeast mixture to batter.  Combine flour and salt.  Beat slowly into the batter, alternating with the scalded milk.  Coat raisins in flour to prevent "sinking" in batter.  Add raisins and almonds to batter.  Divide into three 1 1/2-quart tube pans.  Each pan should be 1/2 full.  To rise, cover and let sit in a warm place for 3 hours.  Batter will almost double in size.  Bake at 325 degrees; for 35 minutes.  Cool 10 minutes. Remove cakes from the pans and sprinkle with confectioners sugar. Yield:  3 pans.
