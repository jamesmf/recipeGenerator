COCONUT-CASHEW BRITTLE


2  c. sugar
1  c. white Karo syrup
1/2  c. water
1  Tbsp. butter
2  c. raw cashew bits
1/2  c. large flaked coconut
1  tsp. vanilla
1  tsp. soda

      Combine sugar, Karo syrup, water and butter in 2-quart glass container; microwave on full power for 17 to 18 minutes, until mixture reaches 270 degrees; (hard-ball stage).  Remove from oven and add the raw cashew bits.  Return to oven and cook 5 to 6 minutes longer, until mixture reaches 300 degrees; (brittle stage).  Stir in coconut, vanilla and soda.  This temperature is very important as the brittle will remain sticky if this temperature is not reached. Pour onto buttered platter, working quickly.  Cool partially by lifting edges with spatula so mixture won't stick.  When firm, but still warm, turn over.  Pull as thin as desired at this point. When cool, break into pieces and store in airtight container. Makes 2 pounds.
