MEXICAN CHICKEN


6  chicken breasts
1  lb. wide egg noodles
2  c. Mozzarella cheese
1  medium onion, diced
2  cans Ro-Tel tomatoes (can use 1 can Ro-Tel, 1 can stewed tomatoes)
2  cans cream of mushroom soup
  crumbled tortilla chips

      Heat oven to 350 degrees;.  Spray lasagna pan.  Boil chicken; remove from water and set aside to cool.  In same water, cook your noodles.  Leave them al dente since they will cook in the oven as well.  After the chicken cools, pull apart.  Mix the soup and tomatoes in a bowl.  When the noodles are done and the chicken is pulled apart, layer the ingredients in pan (noodles, chicken, onion, soup/tomatoes, cheese and chips).  Cook until heated through and cheese begins to brown (30 to 40 minutes).
