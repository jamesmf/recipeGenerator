CHOCOLATE FUDGE SAUCE


1/4  c. cocoa
1  c. sugar
1/2  c. whipping cream
2  Tbsp. light corn syrup
3  Tbsp. butter or margarine
1/4  tsp. salt
1  tsp. vanilla

      Measure cocoa, sugar, cream, syrup, butter and salt into a heavy saucepan, about 1 1/2-quart size.  Stir until blended.  Bring to a boil over moderate high heat.  Boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat and add the vanilla.
      To Reheat:  To reheat conventionally, stir over low heat for 5 to 8 minutes, until sauce is hot.  If using microwave oven, put sauce into glass pitcher or jar.  Reheat for 2 to 3 minutes on High, stirring once about halfway through.
      Good served over ice cream, cakes, brownies or puddings.  Spoon over a scoop of ice cream on a slice of pound cake.  Top with chopped nuts, if desired.
      Tips:  Excellent either hot or cold.  For a thoughtful gift, pour sauce into a pretty jar.  Label and tie a ribbon around the top with instructions for serving.
