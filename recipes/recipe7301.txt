CHICKEN BREASTS PICANTE


2  Tbsp. oil (see note)
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (about 5 oz. each)
1  whole roasted red pepper (see note)
1/2  c. dry white wine
1  Tbsp. tiny capers

      Heat oil in large frying pan. Flatten chicken breasts slightly. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and cook over high heat, turning once, until golden brown and white in the center, but still juicy, about 8 minutes on each side. While the chicken is cooking, cut the roasted red pepper into thin strips. Remove the cooked chicken from the pan. Pour off any excess oil. Add the wine and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly to loosen any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Add the red pepper strips. Stir in the capers without draining. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and serve to 4.
      Note: Hamilton didn't specify the type of oil to use, but olive oil would be good. Use a roasted red pepper from a jar.
