1  medium onion, chopped
1/2  green pepper, chopped
1 (16 oz.)  can tomatoes, diced
1 (16 oz.)  can tomato sauce
1 (8 3/4 oz.)  can corn (whole kernel)
1 to 2  Tbsp. chili powder

      Brown ground beef in large pot. Drain off fat. Add remaining ingredients, except macaroni. While cooking the meat mixture, boil macaroni according to package directions (do not overcook; cook until firm), then add macaroni (including water) to meat mixture. Continue cooking for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Serve with corn bread and green salad.
      Cook macaroni and drain. Put back in pan. Add milk to cover bottom of pan. Add cheese and stir. Add mustard. When noodles and cheese are the consistency you like, add peas and crumbled up tuna. Brooks Fetters
