BUFFALO CHICKEN WINGS


12  chicken wings
1/4  c. Texas Pete
4  Tbsp. margarine

	Cut wings at joints. Discard tips. Wash and pat dry wings. Arrange wings in a foil-lined pan in a single layer. Bake in oven at 375 degrees; for 20 minutes.
	Meanwhile, in a saucepan, melt margarine and stir in hot sauce. When wings are done, drain off fat and brush with hot sauce mix. Bake for 10 more minutes. Turn wings over and brush with hot sauce mix again. Bake wings 5 to 10 more minutes. Serve with Blue cheese dressing and celery sticks. Makes 24 wings.
	You may substitute your favorite hot sauce instead of Texas Pete.
