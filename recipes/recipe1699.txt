BAKLAVA
(Honey and Nut Pastry)  
Pastry:
1  lb. phyllo pastry sheets
1/2  c. chopped almonds
1 1/2  c. melted sweet butter
  dash of ground cloves
5  Tbsp. sugar
1  tsp. cinnamon
2  c. walnuts, pistachio nuts or hazelnuts, roughly chopped

 
Syrup:
2  c. water
2  c. sugar
1/2  c. honey
3  slices orange and lemon rind
1  cinnamon stick
3  cloves
1  tsp. lemon juice

      Pastry:  Place sheets of phyllo pastry in a 13 x 9 x 2-inch pan, brushing every other sheet evenly with butter.  When ten or twelve sheets are in place, combine walnuts, sugar, cinnamon and cloves and spread 1/3 of this mixture over the sheet.  Place another five or six buttered sheets of phyllo on top of nut mixture.  Repeat this process two more times, alternating nut mixture with five or six sheets of buttered phyllo.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees; (180 degrees;C).  With a sharp knife, cut baklava into diamond-shaped pieces.  Heat remaining butter (there should be about 1/2 cup) until hot and light brown.  Pour evenly over the baklava.  Sprinkle a few drops of cold water on top and bake for 30 minutes.  Reduce the temperature to 300 degrees; (150 degrees;C) and continue to bake for one hour.
      Syrup:  In a saucepan combine water, sugar, honey, lemon juice, orange and lemon rind, cinnamon stick and cloves.  Heat mixture until a drop forms when placed into a cup of cold water, then simmer for an additional 20 minutes.  Strain.  When the baklava is baked, pour syrup over it.  Makes 30 to 36 pieces.
      Baklava is a delicacy found throughout the Arab world.  The Jews who came to Israel from Arab countries continue to prepare and enjoy the taste of baklava.  This sweet pastry is sold in both Jewish and Arab markets and comes in a multitude of varieties.
