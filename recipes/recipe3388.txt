ASPARAGUS HORS D'OEUVRES


20  slices of white bread
3  oz. of crumbled blue cheese
8  oz. of cream cheese
4  dashes of Worcestershire sauce
2 (15 oz.)  cans of asparagus

      Trim crusts and flatten bread.  Blend cheeses until workable and add Worcestershire sauce.  Spread on bread.  Drain asparagus and roll one spear on each bread slice.  Baste each roll with melted butter and place on cookie sheet seam side down.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 15-20 minutes or until slightly browned.  Cut in thirds to serve as an appetizer.
      These freeze great.  If frozen, take out and slice; bake at 400 for 10 minutes and then 350 degrees; for 15-20 minutes.  If you this ahead and freeze it, don't add the butter and Parmesan until you cook it.
