NEW ORLEANS PRALINE BACON


1  slab of bacon (12 or 16 oz.)
3  Tbsp. sugar (white or brown or mixed)
1 1/2   Tbsp. chili powder (yes, chili powder!)
1/4  c. pecans, chopped fine

	Preheat oven to 425 degrees;.  On rack of a large broiler pan, arrange bacon slices in one layer and cook in middle of oven 10 minutes or until it just begins to turn golden.  In a small bowl, mix together sugar and chili powder.  Remove pan from oven and sprinkle bacon with sugar mixture and top with pecans.  Return to oven and cool for as long as you desire.  Freezes well for future reheating.	Do not count on any leftovers.	I usually make a lot of the sugar - chili powder mix with the chopped pecans mixed in and store in zip-lock in the freezer.  Then it is handy for quick fixing.  Do not overcook, or sugar will blacken.
