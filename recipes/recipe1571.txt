LINZERTORTE
(Almond Cake)  

3/4  c. butter or margarine
2  eggs
2  tsp. grated lemon peel
1/8  tsp. ground cloves
2  c. sifted all-purpose flour
1  egg, beaten
3/4  c. granulated sugar
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. cinnamon
1 1/2  c. almonds, finely ground
1/2  c. raspberry jam

      A day before you are going to serve the Linzertorte, prepare the dough in the following manner:  In a large bowl, using the mixer at medium speed, beat the butter and sugar until creamy. Gradually beat in the 2 eggs, salt, lemon peel, cinnamon and cloves.  Fold in the almonds and flour until well blended.  Wrap in wax paper and refrigerate overnight.  Use about 3/4 of the dough to press on the bottom of a 9-inch layer cake pan, building a rim around the edge slightly higher than the center.  Over the center of the dough, spread 1/2 cup raspberry jam.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees;.  On a floured board, roll out the rest of the dough to about 1/4-inch thick.  With a pastry wheel, cut out 6 strips 3/4-inch wide.  Place them, lattice-fashion, over the raspberry jam.  Cut the rest of the dough into 1-inch strips and lay around the top edge of the torte or cut out small shapes with cookie cutter and place them around the edge, slightly overlapping.  Brush dough with beaten egg.  Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until golden.  Cool on a wire rack.  Makes 8 to 12 servings.
