BAKED SPAGHETTI


1  lb. lean hamburger
1  jar favorite spaghetti sauce
2  lb. spaghetti noodles
3  Tbsp. margarine
1  jar button mushrooms, drained
1  c. chopped onions
3  cloves garlic
  Parmesan cheese

      Brown hamburger; drain well.  In the hot coated skillet you just used to cook the hamburger, saut√© the garlic and onions.  Set aside.  Cook spaghetti noodles according to package directions. Drain.  Take the cooked noodles and place in casserole dish.  Add margarine and mix until melted.  Add Parmesan cheese and mix thoroughly.  Add meat, onions, mushrooms and garlic to noodles. Add spaghetti sauce and mix well.  Top with Mozzarella cheese (I use some Cheddar too).  Bake in 350 degrees; oven for 45 minutes.  Serve with green salad and crusty Cuban bread.
