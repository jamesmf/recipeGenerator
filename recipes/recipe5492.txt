  sliced mushrooms
  shrimp
  cocktail onions
  chopped artichoke hearts (canned)
  sliced black stuffed olives

      Marinate all ingredients overnight in the Italian dressing. Next day, drain and use liquid for salads.  Serve on small bed of greens.  The longer this sits in refrigerator, the better it tastes.
