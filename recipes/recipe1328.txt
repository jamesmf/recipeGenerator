1  c. chopped onion
1  tsp. egg substitute

      Boil cabbage until leaves are wilted; separate leaves.  Mix all other ingredients and mold into egg-size balls.  Place each on a cabbage leaf; wrap and fasten with toothpicks.  Brown lightly in a greased skillet.  Cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours.  Add a small amount of water if necessary.  You may serve with tomato sauce or plain. Serves 8 to 10.
