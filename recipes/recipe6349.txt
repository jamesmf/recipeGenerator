CHUNKY MINESTRONE


1  Tbsp. olive oil
1 1/2  c. chopped onion
1  medium carrot, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced
2  cloves garlic, minced
2 (14 1/2 oz.)  cans low-sodium tomatoes (undrained), cut up
3  c. reduced-sodium chicken broth
3/4  water
1/2  c. long-grain rice
1  tsp. dried Italian seasoning, crushed
