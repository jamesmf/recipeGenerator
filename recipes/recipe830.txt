DEEP DISH TURKEY WITH DUMPLINGS


1  Tbsp. margarine (diet)
1/2  c. each: diced onion and celery
1  c. each:  thinly sliced carrots and mushrooms
1  Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. all-purpose flour
2  packets instant chicken broth and seasoning mix
1 1/3  c. water
8  oz. skinned and boned cooked turkey, diced
1/8  tsp. each:  poultry seasoning and pepper
2  ready to bake refrigerated buttermilk flaky biscuits, cut into 6 wedges

      Preheat oven to 375 degrees;.  Spray two 1 3/4-cup casseroles with nonstick cooking spray; set aside.  In 1-quart saucepan, heat margarine until bubbly and hot.  Add vegetables, stirring to coat with margarine.  Cover pan and cook over medium heat, until veggies are tender. Sprinkle veggies with flour and broth mixture and stir quickly to combine. Cook uncovered for 1 minute. Gradually stir in water and, stirring constantly, bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and cook, stirring until mixture thickens.  Add turkey and seasoning mix and stir to combine.  Pour half of mixture into each sprayed casserole.  Top each portion with 6 biscuit wedges and bake until thoroughly heated and "dumplings" are browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
