RUTABAGAS AND PORK


1  medium rutabaga
4  whole pork chops
  salt and pepper to taste

      Peel and chop the rutabaga.  Cover with water.  Place pork chops on top and boil until the "bagas" and pork chops are real tender.  Add Corn Meal Dumplings to thicken the soup.
Corn Meal Dumpling:
1/2  c. boiling water
  scoop of corn meal
  scoop of flour
  a little bit of sugar

      Mix well; mixture should be thick, not runny.  Set aside for 20 minutes.  Put a spoonful of mixture in the palm of your hand and form a cake.  Continue until  all  dumplings are formed. Place along side of the pot or on top of the soup.  If placed on top of the soup, you must turn dumplings over while cooking.  Cook for about 10 minutes.
