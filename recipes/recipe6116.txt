DOWN AND DIRTY TORTILLA SOUP


1  medium onion, chopped
1  Tbsp. cumin
3  cans of crushed tomatoes, 1 lb.
2  cans Rotel tomatoes, chopped
4  chicken breasts
1  can chicken broth
6  cloves fresh garlic
1  bunch of fresh cilantro
1  lb. monterrey jack cheese, shredded
1  bag tortilla chips

      This recipe can be prepared in the crock pot in the morning. Put the onion, garlic, cumin, tomatoes, Rotel and chicken in the pot.  You can leave the chicken whole or cut up.  It will shred after it's cooked when you stir the soup.  Chop or cut the cilantro.  Set stems aside for garnish.  Cook over low heat for several hours or speed up the process if you're cooking over stove for a quick meal.  About 20 minutes before you serve, heat the tortilla chips at 225 degrees for crispy chips.  Serve a heap of shredded cheese on hot soup and garnish with diced cilantro stems for flavor and texture.  Serve with warm tortilla chips.
