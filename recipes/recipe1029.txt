HERBED FISH AND TOMATO STEW


1 1/2  lb. cod fillets
  salt and coarsely ground pepper to taste
6  to 8 green onions, thinly sliced
2  Tbsp. butter or margarine
1  clove garlic, minced or pressed
1  bay leaf, crumbled
1/2  tsp. dry thyme leaves
1/2  c. fish broth or dry white wine
1 (1 lb.)  can tomatoes
1/2  lemon, thinly sliced

      Wipe fish with a damp cloth.  Cut into serving pieces. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper.  In a deep frying pan or Dutch oven, cook onions in butter over medium heat until soft and bright green.  Add garlic, bay leaf, thyme, broth or wine and tomatoes with liquid.  Break tomatoes up with a fork.  Bring mixture to boiling.  Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until thick, stirring occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes.  Add lemon slices and fish.  Cover.  Simmer over low heat until fish is opaque and flakes when tested with a fork, 8 to 10 minutes.  Taste.  Add salt, if needed.  Serve fish in shallow bowls with tomato sauce spooned over.
      Note:  You can substitute fillets of sole, flounder or perch for cod.  Serves 4.
