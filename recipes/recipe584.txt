POACHED CHICKEN BREASTS


6  whole skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1  large onion, thinly sliced
2  Tbsp. lemon juice
2  sprigs parsley
1  bay leaf
6  peppercorns
  salt to taste
  chicken broth to cover

      Place the chicken breasts in a single layer in a large skillet. Top with the onion, lemon juice, parsley, bay leaf, peppercorns and salt.  Pour over enough chicken broth to cover.  Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the chicken is just tender and is no longer pink in the center.  Remove from heat and allow the chicken to cool in the liquid.  With a slotted spoon, remove the chicken from the broth and arrange on a platter.  (Strain and reserve stock for another use.)  Coat the chicken with Basil-Lemon Sauce and serve garnished with basil leaves and cherry tomatoes.  Serves 8.
