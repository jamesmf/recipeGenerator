POTATO SKINS


4  large baking potatoes (about 3 lb.)
1/2  tsp. salt
1  tsp. paprika
1/4  tsp. freshly ground pepper
1/4  c. plain low-fat yogurt
1/4  c. low-fat sour cream
2  Tbsp. minced fresh chives

      Thoroughly scrub  potatoes;  prick several times with a fork. Bake at 450 degrees; for  45  minutes  to 1 hour or until done; allow to cool to touch.
      Cut potatoes in half lengthwise; scoop out pulp (carefully), leaving 1/8-inch thick shells.  Reserve pulp.  Cut each potato shell lengthwise into 4 strips and place on ungreased baking sheet. Spray strips lightly with butter flavored vegetable cooking spray. Mix salt, paprika and pepper and sprinkle over strips.  Bake at 425 degrees; for 14 minutes or until crisp.
      In a small bowl combine yogurt, sour cream and chives.  Serve potato skins with sour cream mixture.  Yields 32 appetizers containing one potato skin and 3/4 teaspoon dip each.
