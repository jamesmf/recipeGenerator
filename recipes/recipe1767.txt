      Start preparation the night before or several hours in advance. In saucepan combine milk, lemon peel and cinnamon.  Bring to boil. Lower heat and simmer 10 minutes.  Set aside.  In another large saucepan, beat egg yolks until lemon colored.  Beat in 6 tablespoons sugar, then cornstarch.  Stir in few tablespoons of hot milk, then gradually stir in the rest.  Cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes or until thickened.  Discard lemon peel and cinnamon stick.  Pour into a large greased, rectangular pan and cool.  Refrigerate several hours or overnight. Cut into small squares.  Dust with flour and dip in beaten egg. Heat oil and fry until brown on all sides.  Drain.  Dust with a mixture of sugar and cinnamon.  Just before serving, sprinkle with powdered sugar.  If you wish, serve with strawberry jam.
