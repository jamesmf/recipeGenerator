COLE SLAW


8  c. cabbage, finely chopped
1/4  c. carrot, shredded
1/3  c. sugar
1/2  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. pepper
1/4  c. milk
1/2  c. mayo
1/4  c. buttermilk
1 1/2  Tbsp. white vinegar
2 1/2  Tbsp. lemon juice

      Cut cabbage and carrots into small pieces about the size of rice kernels, (the food processor is great for this!).  In a salad bowl, combine sugar, salt, pepper, milk, buttermilk, vinegar, and lemon juice.  Beat until smooth.  Add the cabbage and carrots. Mix well.  Cover and refrigerate.
