MUSHROOM GRAVY


2  lb. diced mushrooms
  oil
  onion
  garlic
2  qt. broth
1/2  c. whole-wheat flour

      Saut mushrooms in 1/2 cup oil in a 4-quart heavy pot.  Drain, reserving oil, and mix mushrooms with 2 quarts broth, onion and garlic.  Blend in blender until smooth.  Mix flour with remaining oil and brown in a heavy pot over medium heat, stirring constantly. While whisking briefly, pour in broth slowly to avoid lumping. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened. Ladle enough gravy over potatoes or dish of your choice to coat and place under broiler for 5 minutes or until a browned "skin" forms. It is now ready to display as a centerpiece.  Ladle some gravy over each potato or dish of your choice before serving.
