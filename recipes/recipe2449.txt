PEANUT BLOSSOMS


1 3/4  c. flour
1  tsp. soda
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  c. sugar
1/2  c. firmly packed brown sugar
1/2  c. shortening
1/2  c. peanut butter
1  egg
2  Tbsp. milk
1  tsp. vanilla extract
48  milk chocolate candy kisses

      Combine all ingredients except candy in a large mixing bowl. Mix on lowest speed of mixer until dough forms.  Shape dough into balls, using a rounded teaspoonful for each.  Roll balls in sugar and place on ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake at 375 degrees; for 10 to 12 minutes.  Top each cookie immediately with a candy kiss, pressing down firmly so cookie cracks across the edges.
