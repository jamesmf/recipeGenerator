HAMBURGER-SQUASH CASSEROLE


5  to 6 yellow squash, sliced
1  onion, chopped
2  lb. hamburger meat
  salt and pepper
  garlic powder
2 to 3  Tbsp. butter
  small container sour cream
1  box Stove Top stuffing for pork
1/2 to 1  c. shredded Cheddar cheese

	Preheat oven to 325 degrees;.  Wash, peel and slice squash.
	In a large saucepan cover the squash with water, add 1/2 of the onion and bring to a boil.	Squash should be tender but not fully cooked.  You will need some of the squash water so drain over a cup to reserve.
	In a large skillet, brown hamburger and other 1/2 onion and seasonings. When hamburger is cooked, drain off any excess grease, add the butter, sour cream, the season packet from the stuffing mix and the squash.
	In an oblong dish, layer 3/4 of the stuffing then layer all of the hamburger/squash mixture. Top with the remaining 1/4 stuffing. Sprinkle with the shredded Cheddar cheese. Bake for 25 minutes.
