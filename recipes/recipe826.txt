POULTRY CASSEROLE


2  pheasants or 1 chicken or 8 quail
  salt and pepper to taste
  dressing
2  cans cream of chicken soup
6  oz. sour cream
1/2  stick butter
24  Ritz crackers
  poppy or sesame seed
  sherry or white wine to taste

      Simmer for 45 minutes and debone (leave quail whole).  Place meat in baking dish; salt and pepper to taste.  Stuff quail with favorite dressing if desired.  (I use sausage and bread crumbs moistened with chicken stock.)  Mix cream of chicken soup and sour cream and spread over meat.  Melt butter and drizzle over sauce. Crush Ritz crackers; sprinkle over sauce.  Add poppy or sesame seed over all.  If desired, white wine or sherry may be added to sauce initially.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 30 minutes.
