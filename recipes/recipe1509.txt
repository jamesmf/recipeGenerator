BARBECUE BUNS


5 3/4 to 6 3/4  c. unsifted flour
1/3  c. instant nonfat dry milk solids
1/4  c. sugar
1  Tbsp. salt
2  pkg. active dry yeast
1/3  c. softened oleo
2  c. very warm tap water (120~ to 130~)

      In a large bowl, thoroughly mix 2 cups flour, dry milk solids, sugar, salt and yeast.  Add oleo.  Gradually add tap water to dry ingredients and beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally.  Add 3/4 cup flour.  Beat at high speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally.  Stir in enough additional flour to make a stiff dough.  Turn out onto lightly floured board; knead until smooth and elastic (8 to 10 minutes).  Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top.  Cover; let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes.
      Punch dough down; let rise again until less than doubled (20 minutes).  Divide dough in half; cut each half into pieces.  Form each piece into a ball.  Place on greased baking sheet about 2 inches apart; flatten.  Cover; let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.  Bake at 375 degrees; for 15 to 20 minutes or until done.  Remove from pan and cool on wire racks.
