MEXICAN CHICKEN


1  can mushroom soup
1  can chicken soup
1  can water chestnuts, chopped
1  can Ro-Tel tomatoes
1 small  pkg. Velveeta cheese, grated
1  medium onion, chopped
1  chicken, cooked and deboned
2  c. tortilla chips, crushed

      Mix together; put in greased pan lined with chips. Put crushed chips on top with a little cheese. Bake at 350 degrees; until bubbly, about 45 minutes.
