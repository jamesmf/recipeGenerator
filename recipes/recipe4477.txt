CHEESE SOUP


3 (15 oz.)  cans chicken broth or 6 chicken-flavored bouillon cubes and 45 oz. water
2  bags frozen vegetables (any style; mixed is good)
1  can Ro-Tel tomatoes with green chilies
10  oz. Mexican Velveeta cheese

      Boil until vegetables are tender. Cut cheese in 10 (1-ounce) slices and add to vegetable mixture until cheese is melted.
      Note: Can also add fresh vegetables such as carrots, cabbage and onion. If you don't like spicy, just use regular Ro-Tel tomatoes and light or plain Velveeta.
