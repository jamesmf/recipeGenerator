EASY HERB DRYING


  chives
  mint
  parsley
  sage
  basil
  oregano

      Remove stems from herbs.  Rinse well and drain well.  Dry each variety separately.  Loosely pack one cup of leaves, then spread on a paper towel.  Place in microwave and cover herb with another towel.  Microwave on High for 2 minutes.  If desired, crumble. Store in airtight container.  (Empty spice and herb jars, well washed and dried, will work well.)
