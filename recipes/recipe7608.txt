SAUSAGE & CREAM CHEESE PASTRY


2  pkgs. (8 each) refrigerator dinner crescent rolls
1  lb. bulk sausage
8  oz. cream cheese

      Preheat oven to 375 degrees;.  Brown the sausage in a pan & drain. While pan is still warm, add cream cheese and stir with sausage until cream cheese is melted.  In 13 x 9 x2 baking dish, roll out a package of crescent rolls, flat on the bottom.  Do not break up the sheet of dough. Spoon the sausage mixture and spread it to the edges of the pan.  Roll out the second package of crescent roll dough and place on the top of the mixture.  Bake about 25 minutes until golden brown.  Allow to cool and cut into squares for serving.
      You can prepare this, without baking, the night before and refrigerate it.  In the morning, just pop it into the preheated oven for 30 - 35 minutes, until golden brown.
