2  c. sugar
1/2  c. light corn syrup
1/2  c. water
2  egg whites
1  tsp. vanilla
1 (14 oz.)  can sweetened condensed milk
1/4  tsp. salt
1/2  c. light corn syrup
2 1/2  c. chopped pecans

      Mix sugar, 1/2 cup syrup and water well.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved.  Bring to a boil; cook, without stirring, until it reaches firm-ball stage (252 degrees;).
      Meanwhile, beat egg whites in large bowl until stiff.  Slowly pour hot syrup over egg whites, beating until very stiff.  Add vanilla.  Let stand at room temperature, stirring occasionally, until mixture is the consistency of soft dough.  With greased hands, form into two 8-inch rolls.  Chill until firm.
      Combine milk, salt and 1/2 cup syrup in large saucepan.  Mix well.  Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until soft-ball stage (236 degrees;).  Remove from heat; drop each chilled nougat roll into mixture.  Coat evenly.  Work fast.  Remove with 2 spoons.  Roll in pecans.  Chill for 1 hour or until set.  Slice and serve.
