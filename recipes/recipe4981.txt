DUCK & SAUSAGE GUMBO


4 (10 1/2 oz.)  cans beef consomme
3  cans water
2  mallard ducks, cut into serving pieces, (3-4 duck breasts can be substituted)
1  1/4 lbs. andouille sausage, cut in 1/4-inch pieces (smoked sausage can be substituted)
2  medium onions, finely chopped
1  bell pepper, finely chopped
4  stalks celery, finely chopped
1  c. cooking oil
1  c. flour
4  cloves garlic, finely chopped
3  bay leaves
1/4  tsp. allspice
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper
1  tsp. basil
1/4  tsp. powdered cloves
1/2  tsp. poultry seasoning
1  Tbsp. salt
6  shakes black pepper
4  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
4  drops Tabasco
5  green onions, finely chopped

      Make stock with consomme and water in a large, heavy iron pot and bring to a low boil.  In a separate heavy iron pot, brown duck pieces well in hot cooking oil.  (This browning will prevent excess duck fat from cooking out into the gumbo.)  When all duck pieces are browned well, place them in the pot of stock.  Drain about 3/4 cup of the oil and fat from the pot used to brown the duck and set aside for later use in making roux.  Add the chopped onions, pepper, and celery to the remaining hot oil and saut√© until very tender, stirring well.  When vegetables are cooked, combine them with the duck and stock.
      Slice sausage into round slices about 1/4-inch thick and brown in the pot used to brown the duck.  (Cook out as much grease from the sausage as possible.)  Add the browned sausage to the duck, stir well, and maintain cooking at a simmer.  As the mixture simmers, add the chopped garlic and the rest of the seasonings and stir until all are well blended.
      Make a medium dark roux in the pot used for browning the duck and sausage.  Use the oil and fat saved from browning and an equal amount of flour.  When the roux is cooked, remove from heat and add enough stock from the gumbo to thin it; then add the thinned roux to the gumbo.  (If roux is added without thinning, it would form lumps.)
