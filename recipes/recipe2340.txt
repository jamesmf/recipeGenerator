PINTO BEANS
(Old Timey)  

1  c. pinto beans
1  tsp. salt
1  Tbsp. canola oil
1  tsp. sugar or molasses
  water

      Pick any foreign object from beans.  Wash and place in 2 1/2-quart utensil with a cover.  Cover about 1/4-inch above beans with cold water.  Bring to full boil for approximately 1 minute. Drain off hot water through colander.  Cover beans with hot water again about 1/4-inch above bean level.  Add salt and oil.  Cook until tender, stirring occasionally.  It may be necessary to add more hot water while cooking.  When beans are tender and well done, add sugar or molasses, preferably molasses.  More water may be added if soupy beans are desired.
