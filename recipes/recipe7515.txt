CHICKEN WITH MUSHROOM SAUCE


4  to 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1/4  c. flour
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
1  Tbsp. olive oil
1  Tbsp. butter
1  lb. fresh mushrooms, sliced
1  c. chicken broth
  Juice of 1 lemon
1  c. white wine
1/4  tsp. nutmeg
1/3  c. heavy cream
1  Tbsp. chopped fresh parsley

      Combine the flour, salt and pepper.  Coat the chicken breasts with flour mixture.  Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet and brown the chicken on both sides, about 10 minutes.  Lower the heat and continue to cook the chicken until it is cooked and tender, about 20 to 30 minutes.  Remove to a serving platter and keep warm.
      Add the mushrooms to the pan, adding more butter if necessary. Cook the mushrooms for about 5 minutes.  Add the broth, lemon juice, and wine to the pan and bring to a boil, scraping any bits from the bottom of the pan.  Continue to cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Lower heat and stir in the cream and nutmeg.  Cook until the sauce is slightly thickened.  Pour the sauce over the top of the chicken on the serving platter and sprinkle with parsley.  Makes 4 to 6 servings.
