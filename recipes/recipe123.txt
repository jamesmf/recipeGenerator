CANDY CANE COOKIES


1  c. shortening (half butter or margarine)
1  c. sifted confectioners sugar
1  egg
1 1/2  tsp. almond extract
1  tsp. vanilla
2 1/2  c. all-purpose flour
1  tsp. salt
  red food coloring
1/2  c. crushed peppermint candy
1/2  c. granulated sugar

      Heat oven to 375 degrees; (quick moderate).  Mix shortening, sugar, egg and flavorings thoroughly.  Measure flour by dipping method or sifting.  Mix flour and salt; stir into shortening mixture.  Divide dough in half.  Blend red food coloring into one half.  Roll a 4-inch strip (using 1 teaspoon dough) of each color.  For smooth, even strips, roll them back and forth on lightly floured board. Place strips side by side; press lightly together and twist like rope.  For best results, complete cookies one at a time.  Place on ungreased baking sheet.  Curve top to form handle of cane.  Bake about 9 minutes until lightly browned.  While still warm, sprinkle with mixture of peppermint candy and sugar.  Makes about 4 dozen candy canes.
