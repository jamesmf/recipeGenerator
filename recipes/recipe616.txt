STUFFED BAKED POTATOES


2  large potatoes, baked
2/3  c. part-skim Ricotta cheese
2  Tbsp. grated part-skim Mozzarella cheese
2  Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese
2  Tbsp. finely chopped fresh chives
  salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

      Preheat oven to 400 degrees;.  Slice the potatoes in half horizontally and carefully scoop out the flesh into a bowl, reserving the shells intact.  Combine the potato flesh with the remaining ingredients. Stir until smooth and divide among the 4 shells, piling high.  Bake the potato halves for 15 to 20 minutes or until lightly golden on top.  Serves 4.
