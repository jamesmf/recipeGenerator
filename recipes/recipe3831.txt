CHEESE BALL


16  oz. cream cheese (room temperature)
2  oz. pimentos, drained and chopped
2  Tbsp. onion, chopped
1/2  c. green pepper, chopped
4  oz. crushed pineapple, drained
  seasoned salt to taste

      Mix well. Refrigerate until chilled, then form into balls and roll in chopped pecans. Wrap in Saran Wrap and refrigerate.
      I usually make into 2 balls.
