SPAGHETTI SAUCE
(Large Recipe)  


5  lb. sweet Italian sausage
4  c. finely chopped onions
36  oz. tomato paste
100  oz. crushed tomatoes in puree
6  c. water
1/4  c. minced garlic
12  bay leaves
1/3  c. sugar
1/4  c. basil
2  Tbsp. oregano
3/4  c. parsley
2  Tbsp. salt
48  oz. pkg. spaghetti or other pasta

      In a large pot, cook and stir sausage and onions until browned; drain the fat. Add other ingredients except pasta. Mix and bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover slightly and simmer for 2 hours. Stir often. (Sometimes I use a crock-pot.) Makes approximately 36 cups. Cook spaghetti as directed on package.
