MARVELOUS CRUNCH


6  oz. small pretzels
2  Tbsp. dried dill weed
2/3  c. vegetable oil
1  pkg. dry Ranch dressing

 
Approximately 8 Cups Any Combination:
  unsalted nuts
  salted nuts
  toasted almonds
  roasted cashews
  raw English walnuts
  pecans
  roasted salted Macadamia nuts
  oyster crackers
  crispy corn, rice or Wheat Chex
  Cheez-Its

      Place pretzels and combination of nuts and cereals in dry, large brown paper bag.  Add dried dill and dry Ranch dressing. Fold down top of bag and shake so that flavorings can surround the dry material.  Gradually pour the oil over contents of bag.  Turn and shake the bag every 20 minutes for 2 hours.  The bag will absorb the oil that the contents do not.  I leave mine on the kitchen counter so that I can wash up easily.  Place in tin boxes. Better tasting the 2nd day.
