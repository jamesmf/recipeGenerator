SALMON CROQUETTES


3  Tbsp. butter
3  Tbsp. flour
1/8  tsp. salt
1  c. milk
1 (1 lb.)  can salmon
1  egg, slightly beaten
2  Tbsp. lemon juice

      Make a cream sauce by blending butter with flour and salt. Stir in milk; cook until thickened (use rounded tablespoonful measure in this recipe so your sauce will be thick).  Set aside until cold.  Drain salmon; take out skin and bone.  Add slightly beaten egg, lemon juice and the white sauce to the salmon.  Place in refrigerator to chill for at least an hour, then shape into croquettes.  Roll in fine cracker crumbs and fry in hot fat.  Drain on paper towels.
