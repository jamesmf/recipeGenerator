VIENNA ROAST


  Few whole black peppercorns
  Few whole cardamoms
  Few whole cloves
  Few small, thin sticks cinnamon
1/2  cup water
2-1/2  Tbsp. cooking oil + 2-1/2 Tbsp. shortening (combined)
1/2  pound chicken or beef pieces
1  tsp. salt
5  whole, dried red peppers (small)
  1-2 Tbsp. corn starch
8  baby potatoes,  steamed
8  tiny pearl onions
  8-10 cherry tomatoes
5  small green chilies
  Chopped cilantro
  Salt and pepper to taste

      Marinate chicken or beef with salt and set aside.
      Soak black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon in 1/2 cup water for 15-20 minutes.  Heat oil/shortening in a saucepan  (keep the lid nearby) just until it starts smoking.  Add the soaked spices to the oil (including the water) and cover immediately. Over medium heat, let simmer until the water dries.  When water has completely evaporated and the oil/shortening starts to sizzle, add 2 more cups of water (3-4 cups for beef) and let it boil.
      Once the water boils, add the chicken or meat; cover and cook over medium-low heat until tender.  Now add the dried red peppers. Mix cornstarch with a little water to form a smooth paste and gradually pour into the cooked meat.  Stir well to combine.  Turn heat to low and cook for another 5-10 minutes.
      In a separate pan, stir-fry the potatoes in a little oil until nicely browned.  Also stir-fry the onions and green chilies.  Cut a small x into the tomatoes and sprinkle salt and pepper inside. Stir-fry tomatoes also.
      To serve, transfer meat to a serving dish and place the stir-fried items all around the edges of the dish.  Generously sprinkle with salt and pepper and top with chopped cilantro.
