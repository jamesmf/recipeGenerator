DOGS IN A SWEATER


1 (11 oz.)  pkg. refrigerated breadstick dough
8  hot dogs
8  popsicle sticks
  ketchup, mustard and/or Ranch dressing

      Separate dough.  Roll each piece into a 15-inch rope.  Insert sticks into hot dogs lengthwise.  Starting at one end, wrap dough in a spiral around hot dog.  Pinch ends to seal.  Place 1-inch apart on a baking sheet that has been coated with nonstick cooking spray.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 18 to 20 minutes.  Serve with toppings of your choice.  Serves 8.
      Note:  Slices of cheese may be wrapped around hot dogs before wrapping with dough for a cheesy treat.
