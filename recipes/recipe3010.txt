CORN SALAD


12  ears of fresh corn, cut off the cob
1  bunch of celery, cut into small pieces
1  small head of cabbage, cut as for slaw
2  c. sugar
1  pt. mustard
2  Tbsp. celery seed
2  Tbsp. salt
3  green peppers, cut up
3  red peppers, cut up
1  pt. cider vinegar
1  tsp. turmeric (optional, it will make it more yellow)
1  c. water (if needed)

      Put into large kettle and stir often, as it will stick easily.  Cook for 30 minutes after it starts to boil.  Put into jars and seal.
      Note:  if cider vinegar is really strong, adjust amounts of sugar, mustard, water and vinegar.
