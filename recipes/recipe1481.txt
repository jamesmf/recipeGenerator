POTATOES ON A GRILL


  potatoes (uncooked), sliced thin
  green peppers, cut in pieces
1  large onion, chopped (or more if desired)
  paprika, salt and pepper
  butter

      Mix together potatoes, green peppers and onion.  Season with paprika, salt and pepper.  Put mixture on heavy-duty foil and dab butter on top in several places.  (Spraying the inside of foil with Pam helps a lot!)  Wrap the potatoes in the foil real well and cook on grill, turning often, about 1/2 hour.  Can be done in oven at about 400 degrees;.
