FLEMISH BEEF-AND-BEER STEW


1 1/2  lb. boneless chuck or round steak (1-inch thick)
1/4  lb. bacon
4  medium onions, sliced
1  clove garlic, chopped
3  Tbsp. flour
1  c. water
1  can light or dark beer (12 or 16 oz.)
1  bay leaf
1  Tbsp. brown sugar, packed
2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. dried thyme leaves
1/4  tsp. pepper
1  Tbsp. vinegar
  snipped parsley
  hot cooked noodles

      Cut beef into 1/2-inch slices; cut slices into 2-inch strips. (For ease in cutting, partially freeze beef about 1 1/2 hours.) Cut bacon into 1/4-inch pieces; fry in Dutch oven until crisp. Remove bacon with slotted spoon; drain on paper towels.  Pour off fat and reserve.  Cook and stir onions and garlic in 2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat until tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove onions.  Cook and stir beef in remaining bacon fat until brown, about 15 minutes.  Stir in flour to coat beef; gradually stir in water.  Add onions, beer, bay leaf, brown sugar, salt, thyme and pepper.  Add just enough water to cover beef if necessary.  Heat to boiling; reduce heat.  Cover and simmer until beef is tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Remove bay leaf.  Stir in vinegar; sprinkle with bacon and parsley.  Serve with noodles.  Yield:  6 servings.
