      Cover bottom of dish or pan with tamara and add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water (depends on amount of tofu used and size of pan).  Add spices.  Place tofu in marinade for 10 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally.  Heat small amount of oil in skillet (cover bottom).  Saut over medium heat until brown on both sides.  For a savory sauce, add a little water and remaining marinade to skillet. Heat and serve over tofu or accompanying food.
