CHIMIS


1  roast beef (I usually buy the cheapest)
  shredded cheese (I get the Mexican mix; you can use Cheddar or Monterey Jack or a mix)
  tortilla (large ones for full chimis or small taco size for mini chimis; be sure they are flour tortillas)
1  clove garlic
1  small onion
1 small  can diced green chiles
2  tsp. chili powder
1/8  tsp. garlic powder
1/8  tsp. onion powder
1/2  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. pepper
  cooking oil
  sour cream
  salsa
  guacamole

      Cook your roast in the crock-pot all day (approximately 8 hours). Put enough water to cover about 1-inch over the roast. You can add salt, pepper, onion salt and garlic salt if you like but it is not necessary. When the roast is done, remove all fat and pull the meat apart into shreds. Chop your onion and garlic very fine. Heat about 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil in frying pan and saut√© your onion and garlic for about 3 to 5 minutes. Add your diced chiles and then add your meat. Mix well and then add about 3/4 cup of water, 2 teaspoons chili powder, 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/8 teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Mix well and simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes, stirring frequently. Warm tortillas in microwave enough to soften. Spoon meat mixture onto tortilla (be sure to drain juice of they will get soggy) and sprinkle a lot of cheese onto meat and then roll up like a burrito. Do this until all the meat is gone. Serve with salsa, sour cream and gucamole.
      For the large tortillas, you can top them with more cheese and also top with lettuce and tomato, sour cream, salsa and guacamole. Cilantro is also good on these if you like it.  You can also substitute chicken in place of the beef.
