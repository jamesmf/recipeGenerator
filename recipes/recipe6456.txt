CROCK-POT BRISKET


2 to 3  lb. brisket
1  can beef broth (double strength)
1 small  bottle soy sauce
2  Tbsp. liquid smoke
  juice of 1 lemon
2  Tbsp. garlic powder

      Excluding brisket, mix all ingredients together in a large bowl.  Place brisket in marinade.  Cover and put into the refrigerator.  Marinate overnight.  The next morning, before going to school, pour all of the marinade in the crock-pot and place the brisket in the crock-pot.  Turn the crock-pot on low and cook approximately 8 hours or until you get home.  The brisket should fall apart.  It's yummy!
