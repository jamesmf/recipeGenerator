HAM


1  medium to large ham
4  to 5 good squirts yellow mustard
1  c. or more brown sugar
3  c. vinegar
  Coke

	First boil ham in water. Cover ham with mustard and vinegar for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Then take Coke and brown sugar and make a paste with it. Rub this all over the ham (the more the better). Now put in foil-wrapped pan in oven for about 3 hours at 350 degrees; to 400 degrees;. Pour about 16 ounces of Coke to baste with. Cover and baste often. When the Coke is thickening up, your ham should be done.
	You can garnish the top with pineapple and cherries if wanted. You can also add a little cherry or pineapple juice to the Coke you baste with.  Keep ham covered in oven so it won't dry out and baste, baste, baste.
