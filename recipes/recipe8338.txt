CRISPY FRIED CHICKEN


1 1/2  c. all-purpose flour, divided
1/2  c. Italian dressing
2  lb. bone-in chicken pieces
1  tsp. baking powder
1  tsp. paprika
1/2  tsp. rubbed sage
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
1  c. buttermilk
  vegetable oil

	In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup flour and salad dressing to make a paste. Spread mixture all over chicken pieces to coat. Cover; refrigerate overnight.
	In a plate, combine remaining flour, baking powder, paprika, sage, salt and pepper. In another bowl, place buttermilk. Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk, then flour mixture. In a 10-inch skillet, place chicken pieces in 1/2-inch of hot oil over medium-high heat and cook until browned on all sides. On a wire rack in a jellyroll pan, arrange chicken pieces in a single layer. Bake at 350 degrees; for 50 to 60 minutes or until chicken is fork-tender. Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
