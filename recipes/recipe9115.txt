HAM LOAF


2 1/4  lb. ground ham
2  lb. bulk sausage
1  medium onion, minced
1/4  c. chopped green pepper
1  Tbsp. chopped parsley
3  eggs, beaten
1/2  tsp. pepper
1 1/4  c. dry bread crumbs

      Mix ingredients together. Shape into one large loaf or divide into two standard loaf pans. Bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees;. Pour Basting Sauce over loaf and bake 30 minutes more or until done.
Basting Sauce:
2  Tbsp. prepared mustard
1/2  c. brown sugar
6  Tbsp. water

      Stir mustard, brown sugar and water together until sugar is dissolved.
      This makes enough for two loaves. If you make one large loaf, reserve leftover sauce to serve with the meal and thicken it with a small amount of cornstarch dissolved in water.
