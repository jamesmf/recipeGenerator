LASAGNE


1  lb. ground beef
6  oz. ground lean pork
3/4  C. chopped onion
1  clove garlic, minced
16  oz. can tomatoes
15  oz. can tomato sauce
2  Tbsp. parsley flakes
2  Tbsp. sugar
1  tsp. salt
1  tsp. basil leaves
3  C. creamed cottage cheese
1/2  C. grated Parmesan cheese
1  Tbsp. parsley flakes
1 1/2  tsp. salt
1  tsp. oregano leaves
8  oz. lasagne noodles
3/4  lb. mozzarella cheese, shredded
1/2  C. grated Parmesan cheese
3  C. creamed cottage cheese

      Cook and stir ground beef, ground pork, onion and garlic in large saucepan until meat is brown and onion is tender.  Drain off all fat.  Add tomatoes and break up with fork.  Stir in tomato sauce, 2 Tbsp parsley flakes, sugar, 1 tsp. salt and basil.  Heat to boiling, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat; simmer uncovered 1 hour or until mixture is the consistency of spaghetti sauce.
      Cook lasagne noodles according to package directions and drain well.
      Heat oven to 350 degrees. Mix cottage cheese, 1/2 C. Parmesan cheese, 1 Tbsp. parsley flakes, 1 1/2 tsp salt and oregano. Reserve 1/2 C. meat sauce for thin top layer.
      In ungreased 9 x 13-inch pan, layer 1/4 of each of the noodles, remaining meat sauce, the mozzarella cheese and cottage cheese mixture; repeat 3 times.  Spread reserved meat sauce over top; sprinkle with 1/2 C. Parmesan cheese.  (If desired, lasagne can be covered and refrigerated several hours.)
      Bake uncovered 45 minutes. (Allow an additional 10 to 15 minutes if lasagne has been refrigerated.) For easier cutting, let stand 15 minutes after removing from oven.
