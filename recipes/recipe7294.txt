CHICKEN WITH 40 CLOVES OF GARLIC
(Makes 6 Servings)  

24  oz. chicken breast (no skin, no bone, R-T-C; 6 breasts)
40  cloves garlic, separated (unpeeled)
  vegetable cooking spray
1/2  c. dry white wine
1 1/2  tsp. thyme (fresh)
1/3  c. chicken broth (low-salt, if needed)
1/4  c. chicken broth (low-salt)
2  Tbsp. flour

      Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry with paper towels. Set aside.
      Place cloves of garlic in a medium saucepan. Add enough water to cover garlic. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes; drain. Set aside.
      Preheat oven to 325 degrees;. Spray a  Dutch oven with vegetable oil spray. Place over medium-high heat. Add chicken to hot Dutch oven and brown on all sides, turning chicken as necessary. This should take about 7 to 10 minutes.
      Add wine, thyme and garlic to Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over high heat. Bake, covered, for 40 to 45 minutes or until chicken is tender and no longer pink on the inside.
      Transfer chicken and garlic to a serving platter and keep warm. Measure cooking liquid. Add enough chicken broth, if necessary, to measure 1 cup. Return liquid to Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over high heat and reduce heat to medium. Stir together 1/4 cup broth and the flour. Add to liquid in Dutch oven. Cook and stir constantly until thickened and bubbly, about 3 to 5 minutes. Cook and stir 1  minute more. Spoon over chicken.
