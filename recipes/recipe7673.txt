MEAT LOAF CASSEROLE


  your favorite meat loaf (using 1 to 1 1/2 lb.) hamburger
1  can golden mushroom soup
1  qt. green beans, partially drained
1  large bag Tater Tots

      Mix together your favorite meat loaf and put  in  a 9 x 13-inch pan (should be fairly thin).  Bake at  350 degrees; for 1/2 to 3/4 hour.  While hot, spread soup over  meat loaf, then spread on green beans.  Next add Tater Tots  in  rows.  (Sometimes  I use  a biscuit recipe and drop unbaked  biscuits  on  top  in rows.) Put back in oven and bake at 350 degrees; until all ingredients are hot or biscuits are done, approximately  25 to 30 minutes. You  can keep a meat loaf ready in the  9  x  13-inch  pan  in freezer.
