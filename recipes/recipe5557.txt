HONEY POPPY SEED DRESSING


1  tsp. dry mustard
2  tsp. poppy seed
1  tsp. paprika
1/2  tsp. garlic powder
1  tsp. minced onion
3  Tbsp. sugar
2  Tbsp. honey
4  Tbsp. (1/4 c.) red wine vinegar
1 1/4  c. salad oil

      Mix the 6 dry ingredients. Add vinegar and honey. Immediately beat with an electric mixer on low. Add oil slowly in small amounts. Continue mixing on medium, then increase to high speed as it thickens. Refrigerate. Holds well.
       Hint: The vinegar dissolves the sugar. If interrupted, do not stop completing the recipe. The dressing will not stay emulsified.
