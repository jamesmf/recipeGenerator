POSTRE DE COCO
(Coconut Dessert)  

1 coconut to grate or preferably 1  lb. already grated coconut
8  eggs, separate yolks from whites
6 round  Tbsp. sugar
5  envelopes unflavored gelatin
2  qt. milk (cold)
1 (12 oz.)  can evaporated milk
6  Tbsp. cornstarch
1/2  c. water

      Out of the 2 quarts of milk, set aside 1/2 cup.  In this little bit of milk, mix the cornstarch and set aside.  Place the grated coconut, the cold milk and the sugar in your blender and blend. Break up the egg yolks.  Place the coconut milk, the dissolved cornstarch and egg yolks in a saucepan and stir continuously over heat until it comes to a boil.  When it boils, add the evaporated milk and then set aside.  In a separate container, beat the egg whites until stiff; set aside.  Dissolve gelatin in 1/2 cup water; heat until it dissolves, stirring constantly.  When totally dissolved, add to the egg whites while stirring.  Add this mixture to the previously prepared coconut milk.  Mix everything thoroughly.
      Note:  Wet the inside of a 12-inch round metal mold or spring-form pan with water.  Drain the water, leaving the mold moist.  Now pour your coconut mixture into this mold and set aside to cool.  Cover you mold with aluminum foil and place in the lower shelf of your refrigerator overnight.
