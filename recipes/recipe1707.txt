4  c. chicken broth
2  Tbsp. soy sauce
1  tsp. lemon juice
  dash of ginger
1 (10 oz.)  pkg. frozen Japanese style vegetables
1  c. cubed, cooked chicken

 
Dumplings:
1/2  c. all-purpose flour
2  Tbsp. milk

      In large saucepan, combine chicken broth, soy sauce, lemon juice, ginger, vegetables and chicken.  Bring to a boil.
      In a small bowl, combine all dumpling ingredients; mix well. Drop batter by 1/2 teaspoonfuls into boiling liquid.  Cook until dumplings float to surface and vegetables are tender, about 2 to 3 minutes.  If desired, garnish each bowl of soup with a thin lemon slice.
