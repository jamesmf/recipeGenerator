GARDEN PASTA



1  jar marinated artichoke hearts (6 oz.)
1/2  c. onion, finely chopped
1 small  clove fresh garlic
2  c. fresh tomatoes, diced and peeled
1  small bay leaf
1/2  tsp. mixed dry Italian herbs
1/2  tsp. salt
1  Tbsp. fresh basil, finely chopped or 1/2 tsp. dry basil
1  Tbsp. parsley, chopped
8  oz. noodles (egg or spinach)
1/4  c. soft butter
1/3  c. Parmesan cheese, grated

      Drain marinade from artichokes into a 9 or 10-inch skillet. Add onion and press garlic into mixture; simmer until softened. Add tomatoes, bay leaf, Italian herbs, salt and basil.  Cover and simmer for 10 minutes.  Uncover and continue cooking until sauce thickens slightly, about 10 minutes.  Add artichokes (cutting larger ones in halves), and simmer for a few minutes longer. Remove bay leaf and add parsley.  Meanwhile, cook noodles in boiling, salted water just until tender.  Drain and toss with butter and cheese.  Serve with the artichoke sauce and sprinkle with additional cheese, if desired.  Makes 3 or 4 servings.
