10  oz. finely shredded Cheddar cheese

      Lightly butter an 8-inch spring-form pan.  Have all ingredients except whipped cream cheese at room temperature. Whisk together cheeses, butter, spices and sherry.  Spread half in pan. Sprinkle bacon and nuts over all.  Top with rest of cheese mixture.  Press lightly with back of spoon.  Chill, preferably overnight.
