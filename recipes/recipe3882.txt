SAUSAGE AND CHEESE BALLS


3  c. Bisquick
12  oz. sharp cheese, shredded
1  lb. hot sausage

      Allow the cheese and sausage to soften some. Mix all ingredients (by hand). Divide into several large balls and continue to knead each ball until everything is thoroughly mixed. Form small balls (2-inches) from each of the large balls. Arrange on a cookie sheet and bake at 375 degrees; for 15 to 20 minutes (until balls are brown and sizzling). Makes approximately 100 sausage/cheese balls.
