SWISS STEAK


4  cube steaks (about 1/2 in. thick)
2  Tbsp. cooking oil
  flour
  salt and pepper to taste
1/2 to 1  c. water

      Heat oil in pan. Flour steaks and brown. Add about 1/2 c. or more of water. Cover and simmer 40-45 minutes until tender, turning once in a while. Make gravy from leftover drippings, (removing excess fat).  Add water as needed while cooking.
