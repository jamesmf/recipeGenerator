STUFFED PASTA SHELLS


1  c. Ricotta cheese
1  c. Mozzarella cheese
1  pkg. frozen chopped broccoli, thawed
1  medium onion, chopped
1/4  c. fresh grated Parmesan cheese
  garlic salt and pepper to taste
  large jar your favorite spaghetti sauce
1  pkg. large pasta shells

      Mix Ricotta cheese, Mozzarella cheese, broccoli (thawed), about 1/4 cup onion, Parmesan cheese and garlic salt and pepper to taste. Cook shells (about 24) as directed on the box.  Put a layer of spaghetti sauce on the bottom of a 13 x 9 x 2-inch pan.  Drain shells and rinse in cold water.  Stuff shells with cheese mixture and place on top of the spaghetti sauce (seam side upright).  Then spread more sauce on top of shells.  Bake at about 350 degrees; for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  This makes an excellent appetizer, too!  Makes about 20 to 25 shells.
