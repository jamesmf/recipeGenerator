BAKED POTATO SOUP


4  large baking potatoes
2/3  c. butter or margarine
2/3  c. all-purpose flour
6  c. milk
3/4  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. pepper
4  green onions, chopped and divided
12  slices bacon, cooked, crumbled and divided
1 1/4  c. (5 oz.) shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 (8 oz.)  carton sour cream

      Wash potatoes and prick several times with a fork; bake at 400 degrees; for 1 hour or until done.  Let cool.  Cut potatoes in half lengthwise; then scoop out pulp and set aside.  Discard skins. Melt butter in a heavy saucepan over low heat; add flour, stirring until smooth.  Cook 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Gradually add milk; cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thickened and bubbly.  Add potato pulp, salt, pepper, 2 tablespoons green onions, 1/2 cup bacon and 1 cup cheese.  Cook until thoroughly heated; stir in sour cream.  Add extra milk, if necessary, for desired thickness.  Serve with remaining onion, bacon and cheese.
