SMOTHERED SALISBURY STEAK


1  lb. beef, ground round
1/2  c. onion, finely chopped
1/4  c. bell pepper, finely chopped
1  Tbsp. garlic, finely minced
1  Tbsp. parsley flakes
1  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
1  Tbsp. prepared yellow mustard
1  egg, slightly scrambled
1  tsp. salt
1  tsp. black pepper
1 1/2  c. Italian seasoned bread crumbs
2  Tbsp. all-purpose flour
2  c. beef stock or water
1/4  lb. butter
3  large onions, cut into rings

      In a large bowl mix ground beef with chopped onion, bell pepper, garlic, parsley flakes, Worcestershire sauce, prepared yellow mustard, egg, salt, pepper and Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Mix until mixture will hold together.  Form oval shapes. Place shaped steaks into a skillet on medium high heat and brown on all sides.  While steaks are browning, in a separate 2 quart saucepan melt butter and saut√© onion rings until just beginning to brown.  Set aside.  When steaks are brown, remove to a platter. Pour out 1/2 of the oil, then add flour to remaining oil and stir well.  Continue to stir until flour browns the color of peanut butter.  Add beef stock or water, a little at a time, stirring constantly.  Return steaks to skillet and bring to a bubble.  Add onions and butter to skillet, cover and simmer on low for 25 minutes.  Serve.
