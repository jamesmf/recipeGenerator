BAKED POTATO SOUP


4  large baking potatoes
2/3  c. butter or margarine
2/3  c. all-purpose flour
6  c. milk
3/4  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. pepper
1 1/2  c. (6 oz.) shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
12  slices bacon, cooked, crumbled and divided
4  green onions, chopped and divided
1 (8 oz.)  carton sour cream

      Wash potatoes; prick several times with a fork. Bake at 400 degrees; for 1 hour or until done; let cool. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise; scoop out and reserve pulp. Discard shells. Melt butter in a Dutch oven over low heat. Add flour, stirring until smooth. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Gradually add milk; cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened and bubbly. Stir in potatoes, salt, pepper, 1 cup cheese, 1/2 cup bacon and 2 tablespoons green onions; cook until heated (do not boil). Stir in sour cream. Cook just until heated (do not boil). Serve with remaining cheese, bacon and green onions. Yields 2 1/2 quarts.
