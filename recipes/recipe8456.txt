LEA'S LASAGNA


1  lb. ground beef
1  box lasagna noodles
1  pkg. American cheese
1  chopped green pepper
1  chopped onion
1  can of mushrooms
1  can of spaghetti sauce (any kind)

      Brown ground beef and drain.  Next add green pepper, onion and mushrooms together with the ground beef.  In a pot, boil your noodles until you can cut with fork.  After your beef, green pepper, onion and mushrooms are hot, add your sauce.  In a glass dish or a pan, start your layer with your noodles first, your hamburger sauce, then your cheese on the top layer.  Keep on layering like that until you run out of space.  Bake for 20 to 30 minutes on 350 degrees; or until golden brown on top.
