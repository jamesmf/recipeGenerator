LAMB COUSCOUS


3  Tbsp. oil, divided
1  large onion
1  lb. lamb, cut into 2-inch cubes
4  tomatoes, seeded and chopped
2  garlic cloves, halved
1  tsp. ground ginger
1  tsp. ground fennel seeds
1  tsp. turmeric
1/2  tsp. chili sauce (optional)
1/2  cup cooked chick peas
1-1/4  cups couscous
2  carrots, cut into small chunks
2  zucchini, cut into small chunks
4  new potatoes, halved
  Salt and pepper to taste

      Heat 2 Tbsp. of the oil in a large saucepan and fry the onion for 4-5 minutes until softened.  Add the meat and fry over moderate heat until evenly browned.
      Place the tomatoes, garlic, ginger, fennel, turmeric and chili sauce in a blender or food processor and blend to a smooth paste.
      Pour the tomato paste over the meat, add the chick peas and 1 cup water and bring to a boil.  Season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat, cover the pan and simmer gently for about 1 hour. Place the couscous in a large bowl and stir in the remaining oil and about 3-2/3 cups water, rubbing the couscous through your fingers to separate the grains.  Set aside for about 15 minutes.
      Add the carrots, zucchini and potatoes to the stew and cook for another 15-20 minutes.
      Place the couscous in a steamer or colander, making several deep holes in the surface with the handle of a wooden spoon.  Set over the stew, cover tightly and steam for about 5-10 minutes, or until the couscous is hot and no longer grainy.
      Place the couscous on a large serving plate, make a dent in the center and spoon over the lamb stew.
