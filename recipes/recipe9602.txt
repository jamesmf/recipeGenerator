BAKED MOIST PORK CHOPS


  loin pork chops (1 per person, 1/2-inch thick), trimmed of fat
  apples, halved and cored (not peeled)
  onions, sliced 1/2-inch thick
  salt and pepper to taste

      Use casserole dish with cover and large enough to accommodate chops. Place halved apples, skin-peel side down, enough to cover bottom of dish.  Salt and pepper chops.  Arrange over apples. Place onion slices over chops.  Cover.
      Bake at 325 degrees; or 350 degrees; until chops are done, depends on size of chops.  Chops remain moist and tender and flavored with apple and onion.
