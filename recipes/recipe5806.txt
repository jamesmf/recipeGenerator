TACO SOUP


1 1/2 to 2  lb. hamburger meat (super lean)
1  can black beans
1  can pinto beans
1  can kidney beans
1  can corn (optional)
3  cans Ro-Tel tomatoes and green chiles
1  pkg. taco seasoning
1  pkg. dry Ranch dressing mix
  water (rinse each can and pour in mixture)

      Brown hamburger meat. Add all remaining ingredients. Let simmer 1 to 2 hours. You'll probably need to add more water as it cooks. Serve in bowls topped with grated cheese or crushed tortilla chips and cornbread.
