MEAT PIES-OPEN FACE


  Rhodes dough, thawed or 3 loaves frozen bread dough
5  onions, chopped
3  loaves frozen bread dough
4  c. sour cream
  3-5 lb gd. round or chuck
1/2  c. lemon juice
  Salt, pepper and allspice to taste

      Brown onions and meat together.  Cool.  Mix sour cream, lemon juice and seasonings into meat mixture.  Pull thawed dough apart and use 3 logs.  Stretch and shape dough into 5 inch rounds or rectangles with fingers and mold onto the greased pan or cookie sheet.  Spoon large amount of meat mixture onto each dough round. Do not cover filling with dough.  Instead, pinch 4 "corners" of the dough rounds to contain the meat filling.  Fill the cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees; for about 10 mins. or until dough is golden brown.  Reheat leftover meat pies either in oven at low heat or microwave.
