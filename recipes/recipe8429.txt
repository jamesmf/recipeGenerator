BREAKFAST SAUSAGE CASSEROLE


2 1/4  c. seasoned croutons
1  lb. sausage
1  egg, beaten
2 1/4  c. milk
1  can cream of mushroom soup
3/4  tsp. dry mustard
1 (4 oz.)  can mushrooms, drained
2  c. shredded Cheddar cheese

      Spread croutons in a lightly greased 9 x 13 pan.  Set aside. Brown sausage; drain.  Sprinkle sausage over croutons.  Combine eggs and next 4 ingredients.  Mix well; pour over sausage.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.  Remove from refrigerator; let stand 30 minutes.  Bake uncovered at 350 degrees; for 50 to 60 minutes.  Sprinkle cheese and melt.  I use ham instead of sausage and add chopped broccoli.
