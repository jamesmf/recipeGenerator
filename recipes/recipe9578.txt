SARAH'S SEATTLE PASTA SAUCE


1  Tbsp. olive oil
1  lb. ground beef
1  medium onion, chopped
2 large  cans diced tomatoes (1 lb. 12 oz.)
2 (14 oz.)  cans tomato sauce
1 (6 oz.)  can tomato paste
1/2  tsp. ground pepper (freshly ground)
1 1/2  tsp. salt
2 1/2  tsp. oregano
1/2  tsp. thyme
1/4  tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
1  bay leaf
2  cloves garlic, minced
1/8  tsp. cumin
1  tsp. sugar
1  Tbsp. olive oil

      In a heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and crumble the beef into it.  Brown the meat lightly. (Break it up and separate the pieces.) Add the onion as the meat cooks.  When the meat is brown and onions transparent, pour off the fat and transfer to a large saucepan (not an iron pot, they give tomatoes an unpleasant taste). With the saucepan over low heat, add the tomato products and bring to a simmer.  Add the rest of the ingredients except for the sugar and 1 tablespoon olive oil.
      Cook, uncovered, over low heat for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.  Add a small amount of hot water if the sauce gets too dry during cooking. Skim off any fat on the surface.
      Half an hour before sauce is done, stir in sugar and olive oil.  This will not make the sauce greasy, but will round off the flavor.
