BARBECUED FISH


4  lb. red snapper or bass
1  stick margarine
3  Tbsp. grated onion
1  Tbsp. grated green bell pepper

1  tsp. Louisiana Red Hot sauce
2  lemons, sliced
  Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning

      Melt margarine in a saucepan. Add all other ingredients except fish; stir well. Place fish on a sheet of heavy foil and pour sauce over fish. Seal foil making sure there is no leakage. Place on a grill; turn every 20 minutes, being careful not to tear foil. Cook for 1 1/2 hours. Remove from foil (reserving the sauce) and place on grill for 10 minutes. Turn and cook another 10 minutes basting with sauce. Serves 6.
