SALMON LOAF


1 (16 oz.)  can salmon
1  Tbsp. vinegar or lemon juice
  cold water
2  medium eggs, beaten
1/2  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. black pepper
1  slice fresh bread, finely crumbled
1/4  c. finely cut celery and leaves
2  Tbsp. finely cut green onions
1  Tbsp. green pepper, cut fine

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;. Use 7 1/2 x 2 1/2-inch loaf pan and spray with cooking spray.  Drain salmon, saving liquid. Discard skin, but save bones.  Flake salmon lightly, but well with fork.  Crush bones (calcium bonus) and mix.  Add vinegar to salmon liquid and enough cold water to make 1/2 cup total liquid.  Add to salmon.  Add all remaining ingredients and mix well.  Pack into loaf pan.  Bake for 1 hour.  Leave loaf in pan for 5 minutes before unmolding onto serving plate.
