GLAZED SHALLOTS WITH PORT WINE


1 1/2  lb. shallots, peeled
2  Tbsp. butter
1/2  c. vegetable oil
1  tsp. black pepper, coarsely ground
1/2  tsp. salt
2  Tbsp. brown sugar
1/2  c. beef stock
1/4  c. aged Port wine

      Melt butter in a frypan over medium-high heat.  Add shallots, pepper and salt.
      Cook until shallots are browned and tender.  Reduce heat.  Add sugar and cook until mixture slowly bubbles.  Increase heat to high and slowly add stock, boiling it until a thick glaze results.  Add Port.  Heat for 2 more minutes, then remove from heat.  Serves 4.
