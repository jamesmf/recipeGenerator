STIR-FRY ORANGE ROUGHY


1 1/4  lb. orange roughy
2  Tbsp. cornstarch
3 1/2  Tbsp. vegetable oil
2  green onions, chopped
2  carrots, diced small
2  ribs celery, diced

 
Seasoning Sauce:
1  Tbsp. soy sauce
1  tsp. cornstarch
1  Tbsp. white wine or dry sherry
1/2  c. chicken broth
2 1/2  c. hot cooked rice (3/4 c. uncooked)

      Cut each orange roughy fillet into 4 pieces. Coat with 1 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle cornstarch over fish. Roll fish over several times until cornstarch dissolves. Let stand 20 to 30 minutes while preparing vegetables and Seasoning Sauce.
      Heat 2 tablespoons oil in wok or skillet. Cook fish 4 pieces at a time. Remove to a hot platter. When all fish is done, add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil and stir-fry carrots for 1 minute. Add several tablespoons of water if more moisture is needed. Add onion and celery; continue to stir-fry for several minutes. Put fish back in pan. Pour Seasoning Sauce over fish and vegetables. Place rice on a heated platter. As soon as sauce thickens, serve the fish over the rice. Makes 5 servings.
Tips:

      Orange roughy comes from New Zealand, each fillet frozen separately. Three fillets make about 1 1/4 pounds.
      Serve with broccoli or spinach, baked or sliced tomatoes and crusty bread.
