      Heat oven to 250 degrees;.  Lightly grease large cookie sheet.  In medium-size bowl with electric mixer at high speed, beat egg whites until soft peaks form.  Gradually beat in brown sugar until mixture is stiff and glossy.  Beat in vanilla extract; gently but thoroughly fold in pecans.  Drop mixture by heaping teaspoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheet.  Bake 1 hour, until outsides of candies are dry and set.  Remove to wire racks to cool.  If desired, dust candies lightly with mixture of cocoa powder and confectioners sugar.
