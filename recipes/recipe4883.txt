CREAM OF ROASTED GARLIC SOUP


2  large heads fresh garlic
  olive oil
1/4  c. butter
1/4  c. all-purpose flour
1  small sweet yellow onion, diced
1  bunch leeks, green part removed and diced
2  medium potatoes, baked, skins removed.
2  Tbsp. cognac (optional)
1  qt. chicken stock
  sourdough French bread cubes, several days old, sautéed in butter and garlic
1  qt. light cream
  salt and white pepper to taste

      Place garlic heads on cookie sheet, sprinkle with olive oil and bake in 350 degrees; oven about 1 hour.  Let cool.  Cut off end of each clove and squeeze out contents; set aside.  Sauté onion and leeks in the butter until tender and translucent. Stir flour into onion mixture until all butter is absorbed and continue to cook the mixture over low heat for 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly. Slowly add chicken stock, stirring with wire whisk until smooth, and bring mixture to a simmer. Process potatoes in a blender or food processor.  Add to soup, mixing thoroughly.  Finish the soup by adding the cognac and the cream, and seasoning to taste with salt and white pepper.  Heat thoroughly. Serve immediately garnished with croutons.  Yield:  2 quarts.
