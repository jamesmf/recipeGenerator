PICKLED PEPPERS/SAUCE


3  c. vinegar (3 parts)
3  c. sugar (3 parts)
1  c. water (1 part)
  hot peppers (cayenne is what I like), packed loosely, but full

      Combine all ingredients, except peppers.  Bring to a boil. Pour over any type hot peppers packed in hot, sterilized jar.  Seal immediately.  Leave sealed for no less than 6 weeks to work the juice and peppers together.
