CHICKEN AND ASPARAGUS MEDLEY


6  whole chicken breasts (boneless)
  chicken seasonings
1  lb. fresh asparagus
3  Tbsp. margarine
1 large  can Campbell's chunky cream of mushroom soup

      Preheat oven to 375 degrees;.  Pound chicken breasts; add seasonings to taste.  Cut bottoms off the asparagus, leaving them about 6 inches long (most tender part).  Lay breasts flat, then put 3 or 4 spears side by side in the center of each breast.  Spread 1/2 tablespoon margarine across the spears in each breast.  Fold chicken over like a jacket (overlap).
      Spray a square casserole dish with Pam or vegetable oil or grease bottom and sides with margarine.  Flip chicken over so that seams are face down and lie in pan.  Spread entire can of soup over chicken (do not add water or milk).  Cover with foil and cook for 25 minutes, then remove foil and cook another 20 to 25 minutes. (This should thicken the sauce.)  Makes 6 hearty servings.
