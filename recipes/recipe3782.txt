TOMATO RELISH SALSA


3  qts. tomatoes, cut up
2  c. onions, cut up
1  c. green pepper, cut up
3  c. celery, cut up
1/4  c. salt
1 1/2  tbsp. black pepper
2  c. white sugar
1/4  c. brown sugar
1  c. vinegar (white)

      Pour salt on tomatoes, onions, green pepper and celery. Refrigerate overnight.  Drain but don't press.  Put in large kettle and add pepper, sugars and vinegar.  Cook until thick. Boil and stir another 35-40 minutes.  Don't let it stick to pan. Put in hot jars and seal.  Great with chips and meats as a relish. For a milder salsa taste, decrease black pepper usage.
