CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK


1/3  c. plus 1 Tbsp. all-purpose flour, divided
3/4  tsp. salt, divided
1/2  tsp. pepper, divided
2  large eggs, beaten
1  Tbsp. water
1 1/2  c. plain bread crumbs
4  (4-oz.) cubed steaks
5  Tbsp. butter, divided
1  c. milk

      In a shallow dish, combine 1/3 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. In another shallow dish, combine the eggs and water. Place the bread crumbs in a third shallow dish. Coat the steaks with the flour mixture, then dip in the egg mixture and coat with the bread crumbs.
       In a large, nonstick skillet, melt 4 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the steaks and fry for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until cooked through and golden. Drain on a paper towel-lined platter and cover to keep warm.
      Make a white gravy by adding the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet and melting over low heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon flour and stir until smooth. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Stir in the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Serve the steaks topped with the gravy. Makes 4 servings.
