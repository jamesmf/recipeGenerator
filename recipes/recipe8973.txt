VENISON STEAK


2  lb. venison steak (1/2 to 1-inch thick)
1/2  c. flour
3  Tbsp. shortening
2  cans cream of mushroom soup
  water
  salt and pepper

      Trim all fat from steaks. Cut into 3-inch squares. Using a mallet, pound flour into both sides of steaks. Melt shortening in large skillet and brown meat slowly (15 to 20 minutes). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer browned pieces to a 2 to 3-quart dish. Pour 2 cans of mushroom soup and add enough water to cover all pieces. Cover and bake until tender (approximately 2 1/2 hours) in a 350 degrees; oven. Add additional water if necessary.
