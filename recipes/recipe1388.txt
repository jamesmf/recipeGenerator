FISH KABOBS


2  lb. boneless halibut or swordfish, cut in cubes
2  tsp. Worcestershire
4  strips bacon
1 1/2  c. chili sauce
2  bell peppers (1 red, 1 green), cut into 1-inch squares
1  tsp. salt
  few dashes hot pepper sauce

      In a shallow pan, arrange the fish cubes in one layer.  Combine the chili sauce, Worcestershire, hot pepper sauce and salt.  Pour over fish and let stand for 1 to 2 hours.  Drain the fish, reserving the marinade.  Cut each piece of bacon into fourths.  On each of 8 skewers, string a fish cube, a piece of bacon, then a square of pepper.  Repeat, ending with a fish cube.  Grill 4 to 5 inches from heat for 10 to 12 minutes, basting a few times with reserved marinade.
