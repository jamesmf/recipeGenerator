ROSALYN'S CHEESE BALL


1  lb. sharp Cheddar, grated
1  c. pecans, finely chopped
1  small yellow onion, finely chopped
1  c. mayonnaise
1  jar raspberry preserves (with seeds)
  Sociable crackers or other crackers

	Combine Cheddar, pecans, onion, and mayonnaise and mix until thoroughly blended.  Divide mixture in half and roll each into ball.  Place cheese balls on serving platter and press well into the center of the ball.  Spoon raspberry preserves into the depression.  Serve with Sociable crackers.	(Other crackers may be used.)  This cheese ball freezes well without the preserves.  Just thaw and put raspberry preserves on top.
