MINI CHICKEN TURNOVERS
(Number of Servings: 4)  
Filling:
3  Tbsp. chopped onion
3  Tbsp. butter or margarine
1 3/4  c. shredded cooked chicken
3  Tbsp. chicken broth
1/4  tsp. each: garlic salt, poultry seasoning and pepper
1 (3 oz.)  pkg. cream cheese, cubed
  Pastry or Pillsbury pie crust

 
Pastry:
1 1/2  c. all-purpose flour
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. paprika
1/2  c. cold butter or margarine
4 to 5  Tbsp. cold water

      In a large skillet, saut√© onion in butter until tender. Stir in chicken broth, seasonings and cream cheese; set aside.
       In a bowl, combine flour, salt and paprika; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add water, tossing with a fork until a ball forms. On a floured surface, roll out pastry to 1/16-inch thickness. Cut with a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. Reroll scraps and cut more circles. Mound a heaping teaspoonful of filling on half of each circle. Moisten edges with water; fold pastry over filling and press edges with a fork to seal. Place on ungreased baking sheets. Repeat with remaining pastry and filling. Prick tops with a fork. Bake at 375 degrees; for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. (Turnovers can be baked, frozen and reheated at 375 degrees; for 5 to 7 minutes.) Makes about 2 1/2 dozen.
