STUFFED CABBAGE ROLLS
(Kaldolmar)  
Filling:
14  oz. finely ground beef
1/2  c. round grain rice
1  c. water
1  egg
1/2  c. milk
1/2 to 1  Tbsp. salt
  pinch of pepper

 
For Frying:
2 to 3  Tbsp. butter
2  Tbsp. molasses

      Strip the outside leaves from the cabbage and cut out the stalk.  Boil the cabbage in lightly salted water, to be reserved afterwards.  Remove the leaves when they are done.  Don't overcook.
      For the filling, boil the rice in the reserved water.  Mix the finely ground beef with the egg, milk, salt and pepper.  Add the rice after it is cooled.  The filling must not be compact.  Fill the cabbage leaves with the mixture, making a packet of every leaf. Brown the fat.  Add the molasses and place the rolls in the pan with the seam downwards.  Brown them underneath.
      Transfer the cabbage rolls, still with the same underneath to a greased roasting pan.  Clear the frying pan with a little water. Pour this liquor over the cabbage rolls in the roasting pan.  Put in the oven at 425 degrees; for about 45 minutes.  Taste occasionally, adding some of the reserved cabbage water is necessary.
      Transfer the rolls to a serving dish.  Add some water and a bouillon cube to what's left in the roasting pan.  Reduce the liquor.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  (The cream and soy sauce can now be added if so wished.)  Serve with boiled potatoes and jam.  Serves six.
Sauce:
  water
1/2  bouillon cube
  salt and pepper
1 1/2  c. double cream
  soy sauce (optional)
