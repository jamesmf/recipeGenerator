ONE-POT TUNA PASTA


8  ounces elbow macaroni, medium shells or other medium pasta shape, uncooked
2 1/2  c. water
2  chicken bouillon cubes
1/8  tsp. black pepper
1  tsp. fresh basil leaves
1 4-ounce  jar pimiento
1 9-ounce  package frozen cut green beans
1  c. skim milk
4  ounces low-fat Cheddar cheese, grated
1 (6 1/8 ounce)  can white albacore tuna packed in water, drained
1/4  c. chopped fresh parsley

      Bring water, bouillon cubes, pepper and basil leaves to a boil in a 4-quart pot. Gradually add pasta so that water continues to boil. Cover and simmer for 7 minutes, stirring occasionally.
       Meanwhile, dice pimento. Stir diced pimento, green beans and milk into pot, cover and   simmer 6 to 8 minutes or until pasta and  beans are tender. Stir in cheese, tuna and parsley until cheese is melted. Serve immediately.
