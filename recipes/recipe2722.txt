CHERRY EGGS


3  c. sugar
3/4  c. white Karo syrup
3/4  c. water
2  egg whites
3  oz. box cherry jello
1  c. ground nuts

      Mix sugar, syrup and water.  Bring to boil over low heat, stirring occasionally, until a drop of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard ball, 252 degrees; on candy thermometer, about 15 minutes.
      Meanwhile, beat egg whites until stiff.  Add 1 tablespoon jello at a time to egg whites until they stand in stiff peaks.  Pour syrup in thin stream over egg white mixture, beating constantly, about 10 minutes.  Add nuts; pour into greased 9-inch pan.  Let stand 10 minutes, cut in rows (8 x 12-inches), and roll in egg shapes.  Let dry for 2 hours.  Store in covered container.
