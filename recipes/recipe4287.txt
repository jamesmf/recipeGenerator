NOW THAT'S BROCCOLI I WOULD EAT SALAD!


2  bunches broccoli
1  lb. bacon
1/2  c. sunflower seeds
1  bunch green onions, chopped (optional)

 
Dressing:
1  c. real mayonnaise
1/4 to 1/2  c. sugar
2  Tbsp. white or cider vinegar

      Mix together mayonnaise, sugar and vinegar; set aside. Remove stalks from bunches of broccoli. Chop broccoli florets to bite size. Cook bacon crisp. Let cool, then chop into pieces or bacon bits can be used. Mix florets, bacon and sunflower seeds together. Add mayonnaise mixture and toss. Voila!  Yum Yum!
