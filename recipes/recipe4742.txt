COLE SLAW


1 1/4  lb. cabbage, coarsely grated (6 to 8 c.)
2  carrots, grated
1/2  onion, chopped fine

 
Dressing:
3  Tbsp. oil
3  Tbsp. vinegar
3  Tbsp. sugar
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. celery seed
1/3  tsp. dry mustard or 1 tsp. prepared mustard

      Place cabbage, carrots and onion in large bowl.
      Combine dressing ingredients and bring to a boil. Pour over cabbage mixture, tossing to coat. Cover slaw and refrigerate 4 hours, or overnight. Toss again before serving. Keeps up to 4 days in the refrigerator. Makes 12 servings.
      Tips: When preparing the dressing, it may seem like a small amount. After pouring it over the slaw, stir well and it will coat the cabbage mixture.
