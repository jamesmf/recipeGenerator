MINTED CHOCOLATE MOUSSE


1  c. softened butter
1  c. powdered sugar
3  1/2 chocolate squares
4  eggs
1  tsp. peppermint extract
2  tsp. vanilla
2  c. chopped pecans

      The secret to this dessert is lots of beating!!!
      Beat butter and add sugar gradually.  Beat for 15 minutes. Melt, then cool the chocolate squares.  Add to butter mixture and beat 5 minutes more.  Add the unbeaten eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add flavoring.  Place nuts in the bottom of paper muffin cups.  Add filling.  Freeze.  If well covered, these will keep for over a week.
