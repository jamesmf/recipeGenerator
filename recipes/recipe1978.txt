BUUELOS
(Sweet Fried Bread)  

3 1/2  c. flour
2  eggs, beaten
1  tsp. salt
1/2  c. milk
1  tsp. baking powder
  shortening
1 1/2  Tbsp. sugar
  Cinnamon-Sugar Coating or Glaze
1/4  c. margarine

      Combine flour, salt, baking powder and sugar in a large mixing bowl and cut in margarine.  Add eggs and milk to flour mixture and work mixture into a dough.  Knead dough until it is smooth and elastic.  Form dough into balls the size of an egg.  Cover dough and set aside for 15 minutes.  Roll each ball of dough into a circle that is 4-inches in diameter.  Cut a small hole in center of each circle.  Place circles of dough between single layers of waxed paper until all are rolled and ready for deep-frying.  Heat 2-inches of shortening in a heavy pan at medium-high heat.  Fry buuelos with a Cinnamon-Sugar Coating or Glaze (recipes follow) before serving.
Capa De Axucar Y Canela (Cinnamon-Sugar Coating):
3  c. sugar
3  tsp. cinnamon

      Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small mixing bowl.  Sprinkle mixture over buuelos until they are evenly coated.
Azucardo Para Buuelos (Glaze):
1 1/2  c. sugar
1 1/2  c. brown sugar
1 1/2  c. water
3  Tbsp. margarine
1 1/2  tsp. cinnamon
3  Tbsp. dark corn syrup

      Combine all ingredients in a medium sized saucepan.  Heat at medium heat until sugar dissolves, stirring constantly.  Boil mixture rapidly for 1 to 2 minutes or until two drops of syrup run together off spoon.  (The glaze will be a thin syrup.)  Remove glaze from heat and cool for several minutes.  Dip each buuelo into the glaze, one at a time, coating both sides evenly.  Drain buuelos on a rack for 30 minutes (glaze will be slightly sticky) before serving.
