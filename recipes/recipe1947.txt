PISTO MANCHEGO


1/3  c. olive oil
3  c. coarsely chopped onions
2  medium zucchini, scrubbed and cut into 1/4-inch cubes
2  large green peppers, deribbed, seeded and coarsely chopped
2  tsp. salt
4  medium tomatoes, peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped (or 1 can tomato puree)
1  egg, lightly beaten
1  hard-boiled egg, white cut lengthwise into strips and yolk crumbled

      In heavy 12-inch skillet, heat olive oil over high heat until light haze forms above.  Add onions, zucchini, peppers and salt and stir together.  Cover pan and reduce heat to lowest possible point. Cook for about 40 minutes or until vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally.  Meanwhile place tomatoes in 1 to 1 1/2-quart saucepan and bring to boil over moderate heat, stirring and mashing them against sides of pan.  Cook briskly uncovered, until most of liquid in pan evaporates and tomatoes become a thick fairly smooth puree or use 1 can tomato puree.  Stir tomato puree into vegetables.  Then pour in the beaten egg, stirring constantly. Simmer about 1 minute.  Taste for seasoning and serve at once. Garnish the top with hard-boiled egg.
