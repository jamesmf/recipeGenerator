BARBECUE CHICKEN WINGS

Batter:
1  c. cornstarch
1/4  c. milk
2  eggs
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. Accent or monosodium glutamate
  dash of garlic salt

 
Sauce:
3/4  c. sugar
3/4  c. water
1/2  c. vinegar
1  Tbsp. soy sauce
1  Tbsp. catsup

      Use 20 to 24 fryer chicken wings.  Joint the wings; save the tips for soup.  Push the meat to one end of the wing to form a small drumstick.  Dip chicken wings in batter and deep-fry until golden brown.  Remove from oil; place on paper towel to drain. Then dip in sauce; place on cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 30 minutes, basting often with sauce.
