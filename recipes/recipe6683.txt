DELICIOUS MEAT LOAF
(Salpicon al Queso)  

1  slice white bread, crusts removed
1/2  c. evaporated milk, heated
1  Tbsp. oil
1  medium onion (about 5 oz.), minced
1 large  clove garlic, minced
2  lb. lean ground chuck
2  large eggs, separated
3  Tbsp. tomato sauce
1/2  tsp. hot pepper sauce
1  c. diced Cheddar cheese
1  Tbsp. minced parsley
1 scant  tsp. salt
1/2  c. seasoned bread crumbs
  Onion Topping

      Place bread in small dish.  Add hot evaporated milk.  Use fork to crumble soaked bread.  Set aside.  Heat oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and garlic. Sauté until tender, about 5 minute, stirring often to prevent burning.  Place meat in large mixing bowl.  Add sautéed onion mixture but do not mix.  Froth egg yolks with fork and add to meat along with tomato sauce, hot sauce, cheese, parsley, salt and 2 tablespoons seasoned bread crumbs.  Use wooden spoons to mix lightly and thoroughly.  Add soaked bread.  Mix again.  Whip egg whites until soft peaks form.  Fold into meat mixture.  Place long piece of wax paper on work surface and spread remaining bread crumbs down middle.  Place meat mixture on crumbs.  Gently mold into loaf about 14 x 4-inches.  Do not handle meat too much and do not press meat mixture firmly together.  Pull up sides of paper to coat meat loaf with crumbs.  Gently roll meat loaf onto greased pan, placing at angle if necessary to fit.  Sprinkle any remaining crumbs evenly over surface.  Bake on center rack of 325 degrees; oven, uncovered, 30 minutes.  Pour Onion Topping over.  Bake 40 minutes longer, basting occasionally.  Serve hot, cut into slices.  Makes 8 to 10 servings.

1/2  tsp. sugar
