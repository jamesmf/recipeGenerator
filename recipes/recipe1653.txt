RIBBON CAKE


3  c. unsifted all-purpose flour
1  c. sugar
1  tsp. baking powder
1  c. (1/2 lb.) soft butter or margarine
2  whole eggs
1  egg white
1/2  tsp. vanilla
2  tsp. sugar
  jelly or jam (any flavor)

      Mix flour, sugar and powder.  Blend in butter with hands until like corn meal.  Add eggs and vanilla.  Use spoon, work into a stiff dough.  Divide into 2 balls, 1 twice the size of the other. On heavily floured board (1/2 cup flour), roll out the larger ball to 1/8-inch thickness.  Place on cookie sheet (11 x 15 1/2-inches). Smooth to edges; patch corners.  Spread jelly over top.  Roll out remaining dough to 1/8-inch thickness and cut into 1/2-inch strips. Place diagonally across jelly 1/2-inch apart.  Sprinkle sugar over top.  Start baking in a 375 degrees; oven.  Edges will be done first.  When edges brown (about 20 minutes), take pan from oven and cut 3-inch strip all around.  Return pan to oven for 10 minutes.  Remove and cut into 1-inch and 2-inch rectangles.  Keeps 6 weeks.  Makes about 6 dozen.
