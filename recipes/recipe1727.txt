RICE PUDDING


6  c. milk
1  c. cream of rice or 1 cups rice, washed, soaked overnight and crushed
6  small crystals mistaki, crushed (found in Middle Eastern food stores)
1/4  c. orange blossom water (similar to rose water; it is found in Middle Eastern food stores)
4  Tbsp. melted butter
2  c. fine bread crumbs or corn meal

 
The Syrup:
2  c. sugar
1/2  c. water
1  Tbsp. lemon juice
2  Tbsp. orange blossom water

      In a 5-quart pot, heat the milk (do not boil) with continuous stirring.  To the milk, add the cream of rice with continuous stirring until it thickens.  Add the mistaki and orange blossom water.  Stir for 2 minutes, then remove the bread pudding from the heat and set aside.
      Grease an ovenproof 13 x 9-inch pan with 2 tablespoons of the butter, then sprinkle 1 cup of the bread crumbs (or corn meal) on the bottom of the tray.  Pour the bread pudding in the tray. Spread evenly.  Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of bread crumbs (or corn meal) over the rice pudding.  Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of melted butter on top.
      Bake in a 400 degrees; oven for 10 minutes or until firm.  Remove from oven.  Let cool for about 10 minutes, then pour syrup (see following) over pudding evenly.
      Syrup preparation:  In a 2-quart pan, combine sugar and water. Heat with continuous stirring until all sugar is dissolved and the mixture begins to boil.  Add the lemon juice and orange blossom water.  Mix well.  Remove from heat.
