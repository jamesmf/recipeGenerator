PORTOFINO SANDWICH


1  long French loaf or 6 hard rolls
5 or 6  slices Bel Paese cheese
3  slices peeled red onion
3  large sliced, ripe tomatoes
1  (2 oz.) flat anchovy fillets
8  black Greek olives

 
Dressing:
1  Tbsp. olive oil
1  Tbsp. wine vinegar
1/2  tsp. basil
1/2  tsp. oregano
1  minced garlic clove

      Cut bread or rolls in half lengthwise.  Arrange slices of Bel Paese cheese along one half. Top the cheese with the onion rings, tomato slices, anchovy fillets and olives.  (I find it works well to put some on both sides.) Sprinkle with dressing. Top with the other half of bread. Slice into 6 equal portions. Wrap in foil. Refrigerate.
