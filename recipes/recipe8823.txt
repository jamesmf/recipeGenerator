CHICKEN SAUTÃ‰ WITH BROCCOLI


16 large  cloves garlic (unpeeled)
1  bunch broccoli, trimmed into florets
1/4  c. all-purpose white flour
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. black pepper
1 1/2  lb. bone-in chicken thighs, skin and fat removed
1  Tbsp. olive oil
1/2  c. dry white wine
1  c. defatted reduced-sodium chicken stock
4 sprigs fresh thyme or 1/2  tsp. dried thyme leaves
1  tsp. arrowroot or cornstarch
8  black olives, pitted
1  Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
2  Tbsp. chopped fresh parsley

      Place garlic cloves in small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Cook for 5 minutes. Drain; slip off skins. Set aside. Place broccoli in a steamer and steam until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from steamer. Set aside. In a shallow dish, combine flour, salt and pepper. Dredge chicken in mixture, shaking off excess. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning until browned on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.
      Pour wine into the skillet and bring to a boil, stirring to scrape up any browned bits. Boil for several minutes until reduced to 1/4 cup. Add chicken stock, thyme and the reserved garlic cloves; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and add the reserved chicken. Cover and simmer until the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. With a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer the chicken and garlic to a platter and keep warm.
      In a small bowl, dissolve arrowroot or cornstarch in 1 tablespoon water. Stir into the liquid in the skillet and simmer, stirring for 30 seconds to 1 minute or until slightly thickened. Add the reserved broccoli and heat through. Add olives and lemon juice. Taste and adjust seasonings. Spoon the broccoli sauce over the chicken and garlic.  Garnish with parsley. Serves 4.
