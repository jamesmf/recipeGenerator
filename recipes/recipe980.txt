BLUEBERRY SOUP


5  c. fresh blueberries, plus additional berries for garnish
4  c. water
4  whole cloves
  2-inch piece cinnamon stick
2/3  c. honey
  juice of 1 lemon
3  Tbsp. creme de cassis (black currant liqueur)
1  Tbsp. blueberry vinegar
  plain yogurt (for garnish)
  grated fresh orange rind (for garnish)

      Rinse the blueberries and remove any stems, leaves or green berries.  Put the berries in a kettle and add the water, cloves and cinnamon stick.  Set over moderate heat and bring to a boil.  Stir in honey; reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until berries are very tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.  Force the soup through a strainer or through the medium blade of a food mill.  Stir in lemon juice, creme de cassis and vinegar.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours.  Serve in chilled bowls, garnished with a few whole blueberries, a dollop of plain yogurt and a sprinkle of grated orange rind.  Serves 6.
