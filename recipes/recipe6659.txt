FORGOTTEN ROAST


3 to 4  lb. chuck roast
1  envelope dry onion soup mix
1  medium onion, chopped
  Peeled potatoes and carrots (optional)
1  can condensed cream of mushroom soup

      Place roast on a large piece of heavy foil an arrange vegetables around it.  Sprinkle with onion soup mix, then spoon undiluted mushroom soup on top.  Wrap loosely with the corners of the foil, making sure the sides and top are sealed.  Place in roaster pan and bake at 275 degrees; for four hours.
      Note:  I have also used a pork roast and both are excellent!
