CALICO BEAN BAKE


1/2  lb. hamburger
1  c. chopped onions
1  tsp. salt
1  tsp. dry mustard
1/2  c. white sugar*
1 (No. 2)  can lima beans**
1/2  lb. bacon, cooked and crumbled
1/2  c. catsup
3/4  c. brown sugar*
2  tsp. vinegar
1 (No. 2)  can pork and beans
1 (No. 2)  can red kidney beans

      Slightly cook onion; add to hamburger and brown together.  Pour off any grease.  Add remaining ingredients, including all juice from beans.  Mix well.  Place in crock-pot for a couple of hours on high or bake, covered, at 300 degrees; for a couple of hours (it should be juicy).
