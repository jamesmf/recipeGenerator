TOMATO GRAVY


1/2  c. meat drippings
2 to 4  Tbsp. flour (enough to make a paste)
  salt and pepper to taste

      Pour in about 1 pint to 3/4 quart of tomato juice.  Cook over medium heat, stirring, until it begins to thicken.  May use 2 beef flavored bouillon cubes in place of the meat drippings.
