HERBY POTATOES


3/4  c. margarine or butter
1/4  c. chopped celery
1  tsp. dried, crushed oregano leaves
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. garlic powder
  pepper
6  medium potatoes
2  medium onions, thinly sliced and cut in half crosswise

      In saucepan, melt margarine.  Add celery.  Cook until tender. Stir in spices.  Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch slices, cutting not quite through.  Place each potato on a piece of foil large enough to wrap potato.  Drizzle about half spice mixture into slits. Insert half slice onion.  Top with remaining spice mixture.  Wrap and grill over hot coals 40 to 45 minutes.
