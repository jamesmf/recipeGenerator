HOMEMADE CINNAMON ROLLS


1  c. milk
1/2  c. sugar
1  tsp. salt
1/2  c. butter
1/4  c. warm water
1  pkg. dry yeast
1  egg
4  c. plain flour

      Scald milk; stir in sugar, salt and butter so that the sugar is dissolved and the butter melts.  Cool to lukewarm.  Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of water and add to the milk mixture.  Add 1/2 of the flour and the egg and beat by hand until smooth.  Add the rest of the flour which makes a fairly stiff batter.  Cover tightly and cool for 3 hours.  Using 1/2 of the dough, knead it several times and roll to an oval shape.  Spread the top with softened butter (you choose amount) and sprinkle a mixture of cinnamon and sugar on top of the butter.  Roll up jelly roll style and cut into 1/2-inch slices.  Place in a greased pan and allow to rise for an hour or so.  (At this point, they may be cooked or placed in the refrigerator until needed.)  Place rolls into a cold oven when ready to be baked.  Turn oven to 350 degrees; and cook until lightly browned (about 30 minutes).  Top with a simple powdered sugar icing.  Because this dough contains an egg, use the dough within 3 days.
