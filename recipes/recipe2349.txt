OLD TIME SOUTHERN BISCUITS


2  c. plain flour
4  tsp. baking powder
1  tsp. salt
1/4 to 1/2  c. shortening
1/2 to 1  c. milk (buttermilk is best)

      Sift flour, baking powder and salt together into a bowl (or use self-rising flour which has baking powder and salt in it).  Cut shortening into flour with a fork until you have pea sized balls. Stir in enough milk to make a soft dough.  Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead gently.  (Try to handle your biscuit dough without touching it!  That's how gentle you need to be.)
      Pinch off and roll up a biscuit in your hands, placing them on a greased baking sheet.  Or you can roll the dough out and use a biscuit cutter to cut them.  I like to use a small can with both ends cut out of it as my biscuit cutter.
      Bake in a hot oven, 500 degrees;, for 15 to 20 minutes.  Check them often!  For a change:  Try adding a half pound of crumbled sausage and a cup of grated cheese to dough and spoon them out onto the baking sheet!  That makes great sausage and cheese biscuits.
