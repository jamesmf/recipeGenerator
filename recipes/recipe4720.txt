MEXICAN CHICKEN AND CHEESE SOUP


12  oz. boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1  Tbsp. lime juice
1  tsp. chili powder
1/2  tsp. ground cumin
3 (14 1/2 oz.)  cans reduced-sodium chicken broth
3  c. broken baked tortilla chips
2  c. shredded Colby-Jack cheese blend or 4-cheese Mexican blend, divided use
1/2  c. bottled salsa
1/2  c. sour cream (optional)
2 plum tomatoes, cut in thin  slices (optional)
1  Tbsp. chopped cilantro

      Brush both sides of chicken with lime juice. Sprinkle chili powder and cumin evenly over both sides; let stand 10 minutes. Grill or broil chicken until cooked through. Cool; cut into 1/2-inch pieces.
      Meanwhile, bring broth to a boil in a large saucepan. Add tortilla chips; turn off heat, cover and let stand 10 minutes. Puree mixture in batches in food processor or blender; return to saucepan. Stir 1 1/2 cups cheese into broth mixture. Cook over medium heat until melted, stirring frequently. Stir in salsa and chicken to heat through. Ladle into bowls; top with sour cream or tomatoes, if desired. Add cilantro and remaining cheese. Makes 6 serving.
