BOUNTIFUL BLACK BEAN SOUP


1  lb. dried black beans, rinsed and picked over
4  qt. chicken broth (homemade or canned)
1  bunch celery with leaves, chopped
1  lb. carrots, chopped
2  large onions, chopped
  grated zest of 1 large lemon
1/4  c. fresh lemon juice
1  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. freshly ground black pepper
1 large lemon, thinly sliced and then  slices quartered

      In large saucepan, combine beans with enough water to cover by 1-inch. Bring to boil over high heat. Boil 1 minute. Remove pan from heat. Cover tightly and let stand 1 hour (or soak beans overnight in large bowl with enough cold water to cover by 1-inch). Drain beans.
       In 5-quart Dutch oven or soup kettle, combine drained beans, chicken broth, celery, carrots, onions and lemon zest. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, until liquid is just below surface of beans and ingredients are very tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Using slotted spoon, transfer soup solids, in batches, to food processor and puree. Transfer puree to large bowl. Add cooking liquid.  (Or puree solids and liquid together in blender. You may also force soup through coarse sieve or pass it through a food mill. Discard skins left in sieve or mill.) Return soup to Dutch oven. Stir in lemon juice, salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until heated through. Place 1 quartered lemon slice in bottom of each bowl. Ladle in soup and serve immediately. Makes 10 to 12 servings.
