MEATBALLS AND ONION GRAVY


1  lb. ground chuck
1/2  onion, chopped
  TexJoy steak seasoning
6 to 10  Saltine crackers or about 1/3  c. oatmeal, (or to your taste)
1  egg, slightly beaten
1 to 2  pkg. McCormick Onion gravy mix
  salt and pepper

      Place ground chuck in a bowl, season with TexJoy steak seasoning. Crush crackers finely and add to meat; mix. Add onion and egg. Mix well and form into small balls. Drop into medium hot skillet, that has been sprayed with Pam, and brown lightly on all sides, taking care not to stir the meatballs too much, or they will fall apart. If there is excessive grease, drain. (A small amount left in skillet adds to the flavor.)
      Mix McCormick's Onion Gravy mix in a small amount of water, stirring until dissolved. Add gravy mix and water to skillet with meatballs. Add water to desired consistency. Stir very gently. Let simmer for about 10 minutes. Add salt and pepper to your taste. Serve over rice. Quick and easy! So very good!
