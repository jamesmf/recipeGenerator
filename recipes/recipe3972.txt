HAM OR CHICKEN PUFFS


1  c. water
1  stick margarine
1  c. self rising flour
4  eggs
  ham salad or chicken salad

      Bring water and margarine to boil.  Add flour, and stir.  It will have the consistency of Play Dough.  Stir about 1 minute. Take off stove.  Stir in eggs, one at a time.  Drop by spoonfuls on cookie sheet.  (You may need to add a little flour to make it a good drop consistency.)   Bake at 400 degrees; for 30 minutes.  Cut each roll in two pieces; stuff with ham salad or chicken salad.
      Note: The rolls will be hollow inside, making them easy to stuff.
