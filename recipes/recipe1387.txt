COUNTRY STYLE RIBS


4  lb. country style ribs*
  water to cover

      Place 4 pounds country style ribs in large pan; add enough water to cover.  Cover; heat to boiling.  Reduce heat; cook 1 hour. Remove ribs; drain.  Place bone side down on grill 3 inches from medium coals.  Cook about 30 minutes, turning frequently.
      Prepare Orange Sauce.  Spoon sauce over ribs; cook 5 minutes. Turn; spoon more sauce on other side of ribs and cook 5 minutes longer or until ribs are done.  Makes 4 servings.
Orange Sauce:
1/3  c. orange marmalade
1/4  c. lemon juice
1/4  c. soy sauce
1  clove garlic, minced
2  tsp. cornstarch
2  Tbsp. water

      In saucepan mix marmalade, lemon juice, soy sauce and garlic. Mix cornstarch and water until smooth; stir into saucepan.  Cook, stirring constantly, just until mixture thickens and boils.
      *Thick meat from the rib end of the pork loin.  If you prefer to use spareribs, decrease cooking time in water to 20 minutes; increase cooking time on grill to 50 minutes.
      These are best and tastiest done on your outdoor grill, say at a Fourth of July picnic.  Enjoy!
