BARBECUED CHICKEN


1  chicken (cut up)
1  can Coke
1  bottle ketchup
  Salt/pepper

      Take a skillet, no grease no spray stuff.  Place chicken in the skillet as you would if you were going to fry it.  Do not use any oil, grease, or spray.  Turn the stove on medium and pour ketchup onto each piece of chicken, then salt and pepper it.  Pour the Coke over the chicken, covering it as you would if you were using cooking oil to fry it.  Let it cook until done.  You do not have to turn it, just check to see that it isn't sticking.  When it is done, it will be very tender and the Coke and ketchup will have made a BBQ sauce which is good.  Enjoy!
