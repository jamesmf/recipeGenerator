HOMEMADE NOODLES


3 1/8 to 3 1/4  c. flour
1/3  c. milk
1  c. egg yolks
1/4  tsp. salt

      Sift flour and salt into medium sized mixing bowl and form a well.  Place eggs and milk inside of well and beat lightly. Gradually mix flour and egg batter by hand.  When dough mixture becomes moderately stiff and can be rolled out, turn it out onto a lightly floured board and knead.  Roll very thin on floured board; let dry 20 minutes.  Roll up and cut into 1/4-inch strips.  Unroll. Spread out and let dry 2 hours or until breakable.  Freeze or store in container until needed.
