      Cream sugar and lard until fluffy.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Sift soda, baking powder and flour together; add to creamed mixture, alternately with milk and vanilla.  Roll dough to 1/4-inch thickness on lightly floured surface.  Cut into desired shapes.  Put on greased cookie sheet. Bake in preheated 350 degrees; oven for 9 minutes or until lightly browned. Makes about 4 dozen.  Cool.
      Put 1/4 cup boiling water in a small bowl.  Stir in sifted powdered sugar until thick enough to spread with pastry brush. Beat thoroughly.  Divide into small bowls or cups for as many colors as you desire and add food coloring.  Let the kids paint the cookies with the glaze, using a pastry brush.
