SOUTHWESTERN SHREDDED CHICKEN SALAD


2  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (about 5 oz. each)
1 (14.5 oz.)  can fat-free, low-sodium chicken broth
1/4  tsp. ground cumin
1 (15 oz.)  can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 1/4  c. diced ripe tomato
1 (8.5 oz.)  can whole kernel corn, drained
1  head finely chopped iceberg or other lettuce
1 (4 oz.)  can diced green chiles
1/2  c. chopped fresh cilantro
1/4  c. light mayonnaise
3 to 4  Tbsp. fresh lime juice
  salt and pepper to taste
  lime wedges

      Trim chicken breasts of visible fat. In a shallow saucepan, bring broth and cumin to a boil. Add chicken breasts and reduce heat to low. Simmer gently until chicken is done, about 10 minutes. Do not allow to boil. Remove chicken from broth and allow to cool slightly. When chicken is cool enough to handle, use 2 forks and pull with the tines of each fork in the opposite direction, shredding the chicken. Set aside.
      Bring the broth to a boil and reduce until it measures 1 cup, about 5 to 7 minutes. Allow to cool. Stir in mayonnaise and lime juice to taste. Toss the chicken with a small amount of the dressing and reserve the rest of the dressing for the salad.
      Arrange the salad by spreading the chopped lettuce on a 10-inch serving platter. Starting from the outside of the platter and working in, make a ring of kidney beans, a ring of tomatoes, a ring of corn and a ring of green chiles. Pile the chicken in the center. Sprinkle the entire salad with cilantro. Drizzle the salad with remaining dressing and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with lime wedges. Makes 6 servings.
