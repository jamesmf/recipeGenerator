COLE SLAW - OH SO EASY!


1  head of cabbage grated or cheat and buy a bag already grated
5  tbsp of Miracle Whip - ONLY MIRACLE WHIP (Not Mayonnaise)
3  tbsp of sugar
2  tbsp of white vinegar

      Mix all but cabbage.  Slowly add grated cabbage to desired consistency.  Can be used right away but better to refrigerate for an hour or so.  Stir then serve.  You might add more cabbage to the consistency you like after removing from refrigerator.
