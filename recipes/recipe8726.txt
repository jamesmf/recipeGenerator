1  c. Uncle Ben's rice
1/2  tsp. gd. cumin
1 1/2  lb. lean steak or lamb, chopped
1/2  c. pine nuts

      Wash rice & squeeze out excess water.  Place in large mixing bowl. Add chopped meat, salt, pepper, cumin & garlic powder.  In a pan, melt butter. Lightly brown the pine nuts (stirring so it will not burn). Add to rice mixture. Mix well.  Spread grape leaves flat with stem facing you & smooth sides down.  Place approx. 1 tsp. of rice mixture width-wise across the grape leaf (more or less according to leaf size).  Roll leaf away from you after firming mixture into a roll and tuck in each side of grape leaf. Continue to roll.  Squeeze rolled grape leaf gently to help firm filling and distribute evenly.  Line a large 6 qt. stainless steel pot with flat grape leaves.  Layer the rolled leaves in alternate directions for easy layer to facilitate even cooking.  Fill pot with rolled leaves, add whole green onion & mint leaves.  Chopped garlic on top.  Cover with water and a heavy dinner plate.  Bring to a boil and lower heat to medium.  Simmer for 20 mins.  Add lemon juice & cook for additional 15 mins.
