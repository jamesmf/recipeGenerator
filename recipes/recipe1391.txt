ROCK LOBSTER TAILS


6  frozen lobster tails
1/4  c. lemon juice
1/2  c. butter
  salt

      Thaw lobster tails.  Cut underside membrane around edge and remove.  Grasp tail in both hands; bend backwards toward shell side or crack or insert skewers to keep tail flat.  This will prevent curling.  Combine lemon juice, butter and salt.  Grill tail 5 minutes, flesh side down.  Turn and brush with butter mixture. Grill flesh side up for 10 to 20 minutes or until lobster has lost its transparency and is opaque.
