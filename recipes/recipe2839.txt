HOLIDAY SAUSAGES


1  pkg. tiny sausages
  white wine
  ready made biscuit dough

      Cook tiny pig sausages in dry white wine to cover, simmering them gently for 10 to 15 minutes.  Pour off the wine.  Roll the sausages in biscuit dough, pinching the edges to seal in.  Arrange in a buttered baking dish; brush them well with melted butter. Bake at 400 degrees; until crisp and brown, about 20 minutes.
