SHRIMP AND PASTA SALAD


1/3  c. diced onion
1/3  c. diced kosher dill pickle
3/4  c. sliced black olives
1 small  can shrimp
3/4  c. sliced green olives
1 small  pkg. macaroni
  some pickle juice
3  diced hard-boiled eggs
1  c. sliced celery
1/2  tsp. prepared mustard
1  c. mayonnaise

      The night before, arrange onion, dill pickle, black olives, shrimp and green olives in layers, starting with the diced onion. On the following day, cook macaroni; drain and stir in some pickle juice, tossing several times to allow flavor to blend in.  You should have about 3 cups of the macaroni.  Add remaining ingredients to the macaroni and then combine all with the first mixture, stirring lightly.  Cool several hours or overnight.
