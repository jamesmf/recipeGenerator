BENEDICTINE CHEESE SPREAD


8  oz. cream cheese (not the soft kind)
1  medium cucumber, grated
1  small onion, grated
1 scant  tsp. salt
  dash of Tabasco
  mayonnaise (about 1 Tbsp.)
  green food coloring

      Peel and grate the cucumber, down to the seed (do not use seed).
      Grate onion and mix with cucumber.  Place this mixture in a towel, either paper or cloth, and squeeze until dry.
      Mash the cheese with a fork until soft or smooth.  Now mix in the cucumber, onion, salt, and tabasco.  Mix well.
      Add enough mayonnaise to make the spread smooth.  Then add green food coloring on drop at a time until cheese is a light green color.
      This spread has a delicate flavor and does better on white rather than whole grain.
