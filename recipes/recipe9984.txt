SMOTHERED POTATOES


6  to 8 medium potatoes
2  medium onions, chopped fine
3 to 5  tsp. cooking oil
1/2  tsp. garlic, minced or powder
  salt to taste
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper

	Peel and wash potatoes. Dice potatoes into pot; add chopped onions, salt and pepper, along with cooking oil and garlic. Stir to mix well and cook on low-medium heat until potatoes are tender. If needed, you can add a little water (maybe 1/2 cup) to finish cooking (like to steam them and make them creamy).
