BRISKET ON THE GRILL


1 12 to 14  lb. brisket
1  onion, diced
1  sweet pepper, diced
1  Tbsp. butter
2  c. Worcestershire Sauce, Heinz 57 Sauce, A-1 Steak Sauce (leftovers, any combination)

      Sauté onion and pepper in butter until golden brown. Marinate the brisket in the 2 cups of sauces in a large pan in the refrigerator for 2 hours.  Remove from refrigerator.  Leave in same pan, just add sautéed vegetables on top and cover with foil. Bake for 4 hours in oven.  Then place on covered grill for 2 hours.  You can use charcoal, but natural wood coals work best.
