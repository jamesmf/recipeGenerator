TUNA CUTLETS


2  cans tuna, in water or oil
2  small potatoes, boiled
  Juice of one lemon or lime
1/4  bunch chopped cilantro
1/2  cup finely chopped green onions
2  small green chilies, finely chopped
1  small onion, finely chopped
  Salt to taste
  Crushed red pepper flakes
1-1/2  tsp. garam masala powder
2  eggs, beaten
  Cooking oil

      Drain tuna well.  Lightly mash the potatoes, leaving small lumps.  Mix in the lemon juice, cilantro, green onions, green chilies, onion, salt, red pepper flakes, and garam masala.  Now add the tuna and mix well.
      With wet hands, shape into flat ovals.  If cutlets feel too soft, sprinkle some breadcrumbs to coat.  Heat about 5 Tbsp. oil in a non-stick frying pan.  Dip cutlets in beaten egg and pan-fry, turning once, until light golden.  Serve with hot chili sauce.
