ENCHILADA SOUP


1  small onion, chopped
1  Tbsp. steak sauce
1  garlic clove, crushed
1  tsp. ground cumin
2  Tbsp. vegetable oil
1  tsp. chili powder
1  can cream of chicken soup
2  tsp. Worcestershire
1  can chicken broth
2  Tbsp. enchilada seasoning
1  can beef broth
  paprika
1  can (4 oz.) chopped green chilies undrained
1  bag Tostitos chips
1  jar (15 oz.) of queso cheese dip
1 1/2   c. water
1 to 2  lb. ground meat
1/8  tsp. black pepper

      Saut√© onion and garlic in oil over medium high heat. Add ground meat to onions and garlic; brown. Add undiluted soups, chilies, water, steak sauce, Worcestershire sauce, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and enchilada seasoning; bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat; simmer 1 hour. Add chips and queso cheese dip. Simmer uncovered 10 minutes. Sprinkle with paprika and serve.
      Note: The more chips added, the thicker the soup will be. Also, you can substitute 3 boneless chicken breasts for the ground meat, using chicken broth instead of plain water.
