CHOCOLATE COVERED PRETZELS


1 (6 oz.)  pkg. (1 c.)  Nestle Toll House semi-sweet chocolate morsels
2  Tbsp. corn syrup
2  Tbsp. vegetable shortening
1 1/2  tsp. water
25  to 30 (3-inch) pretzel twists

      Over hot (not boiling) water, combine Nestle Toll House semi-sweet chocolate morsels, corn syrup, shortening and water; stir until morsels melt and mixture is smooth.  Remove from heat but keep mixture over hot water.  Dip pretzels into chocolate mixture to coat evenly.  Place pretzels on wire racks set over waxed paper.  Chill in refrigerator until coating sets (about 10 minutes).  Remove from refrigerator and let stand at room temperature until surface dries, about 1 hour.  Makes 25 to 30 pretzels.
