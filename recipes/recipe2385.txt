CHOCOLATE PIE


  pie shell
5  Tbsp. cocoa
5  Tbsp. flour (self-rising)
1 1/2  c. sugar
4  eggs, separated (yolks only)
1  c. milk
2  c. milk
3  tsp. butter
1  tsp. vanilla

      Bake pie shell.  I use the ones in the boxes and bake as directed (let cool).  Mix together cocoa, flour, sugar and eggs. Add 1 cup milk slowly until mixture is smooth.
      In a pot, put the 2 cups of milk (I use a heavy pot because of tendency to scorch or stick).  Heat milk to boiling.  Add mixture (of cocoa, etc.) to milk, stirring often.  Let mixture come to boil for 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Add 3 teaspoons butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Stir well into filling.  Pour into pie shell.
      Beat egg whites with 4 tablespoons sugar until stiff (I beat them on high speed).  Place on pie; brown in oven (I brown on broil).  Put in refrigerator to set and cool.
