DRESSING


5  c. cornbread and 5 c. biscuits (2 pkg. each if you use a mix), broken into pieces
1 1/2  c. onions
1  c. celery
1/2  c. margarine
4  eggs, boiled and chopped
1  tsp. pepper
2  tsp. salt
1  tsp. sage
4 more  c. chicken broth

      Combine cornbread and biscuits in large baking dish and pour 4 cups chicken broth over cornbread and biscuits. Let soak. Chop onions and celery. Cook onion and celery in margarine over low heat until tender. Mix together remaining ingredients. Add celery, onion, eggs, salt, pepper, sage and broth to first mix. Stir as little as possible. (Overstirring will cause dressing to be soggy.) Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees; for 1 hour.
