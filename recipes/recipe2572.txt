GREEN PEPPER STEAK


1  lb. beef chuck or round, fat trimmed
1/4  c. soy sauce
1  garlic clove
1 1/2  tsp. grated fresh ginger or 1/2 tsp. ground
1  c. green onions, thinly sliced
1  c. red or green peppers, cut into 1-inch squares
2  stalks celery, thinly sliced
1  Tbsp. cornstarch
1  c. water
2  tomatoes, cut into wedges

      With  a  very  sharp  knife, cut beef across grain into thin slices,  1/8-inch  thick.  Combine soy sauce, garlic and ginger; add beef.  Toss and set aside while preparing vegetables.
      Heat oil in large frying pan or wok.  Add beef and toss over high heat until brown.  Taste meat.  If it is not tender, cover and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes over low heat.  Turn heat up and add vegetables.  Toss until vegetables are tender-crisp, about 10 minutes.  Mix cornstarch and water.  Add to pan; stir and cook until thickened.  Add tomatoes and heat through.
