CRUSTLESS LEEK AND POTATO QUICHE


2  tsp. unsalted butter
3  medium size leeks, quartered lengthwise, sliced crosswise 1/2-inch thick and rinsed well
1  large all-purpose potato (8 oz.), peeled and cut in 1/2-inch cubes
1/4  tsp. black pepper
1/4  tsp. salt
1/3  c. water
2  large eggs
1  large egg white
1  c. skim milk
1/2  c. part-skim Ricotta cheese
3  Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese

      Preheat oven to 375 degrees;.  Lightly grease a 10-inch quiche dish or pie pan; set side. In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter. Add leeks, potato, salt and pepper and cook, stirring for 1 minute.  Add the water and simmer, covered, for 12 minutes, stirring occasionally.
      Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine eggs, egg white, milk, Ricotta cheese and 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese.  Add the leek mixture and stir to combine.
