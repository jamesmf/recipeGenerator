FUNNEL CAKES


2  eggs
1  c. milk
1 3/4  c. unsifted all-purpose flour
2  Tbsp. sugar
1  tsp. baking powder
1/4  tsp. salt
  dash of cinnamon (1/4 tsp. at least)
  vegetable oil
  confectioners sugar

      Beat eggs.  Beat in milk gradually.  (You will need to add more milk to make it as thin as pancake batter.)  Add flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon.  Beat until smooth.  Cook in skillet 3/4 full of hot oil.  Cook until that side is done.  Turn and cook the other side.  Remove and drain well.  Sprinkle with confectioners sugar.
