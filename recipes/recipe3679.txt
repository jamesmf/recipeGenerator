CHICKEN CRESCENT WREATH


2  tubes (8 oz. each) crescent rolls
1  c. (4 oz.) shredded cheese
2/3  c. cream of chicken soup
1 1/2  c. chopped fresh broccoli
1/2  c. chopped sweet red pepper
1/4  c. chopped chestnut
1  can (5 oz.) chicken, chopped
2  Tbsp. chopped onion

      Arrange crescent rolls on a 12 inch pizza pan forming a ring with pointed ends facing the outer edge of pan with wide ends overlapping.  Combine remaining ingredients, spoon over wide ends of rolls.  Fold points over filling and tuck under wide ends (filling will be visible).  Move the rolls in a bit from the edge of the pan so filling does not cook over edge of pan.  Bake 375 degrees; for 20 to 25 minutes.
