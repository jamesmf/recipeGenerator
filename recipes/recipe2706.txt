FRUIT-GLAZED EASTER HAM

1 (8 oz.)  can crushed pineapple, drained
1/3  c. orange marmalade
2  Tbsp. lemon juice
1/4  tsp. ground cinnamon
  dash of allspice

      Place ham, fat side up, on rack in open roasting pan.  Insert meat thermometer so bulb is centered in thickest part.  Be careful bulb does not rest in fat or on bone.  Do not add water.  Do not cover.  Roast at 325 degrees; until meat thermometer registers 130 degrees; to 140 degrees; for "fully cooked" half ham (18 to 24 minutes per pound) or 160 degrees; for a "cook before eating" half ham (22 to 25 minutes per pound).
      Meanwhile, place pineapple, orange marmalade, lemon juice, cinnamon and allspice in small saucepan and cook slowly for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat; stir in coconut. Spread glaze over ham during last 20 minutes of baking time.
