PRETZEL CHICKEN


3  pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast
2  cups pretzel crumbs
2  eggs
1/2  cup milk

      Take 1 bag of pretzels, run through blender to prepare pretzel crumbs.  Unused crumbs can be saved in the freezer.
      Cut the chicken into strips.  Beat eggs in bowl.  Add milk. Dip chicken into egg mixture then shake in zip lock bag with pretzel crumbs.
      Remove and place chicken in a deep fryer preheated to 400 degrees.  When golden brown, remove and drain on paper towels to absorb excess oil.  Enjoy!
