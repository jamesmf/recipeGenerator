BUFFALO WINGS



1  bottle (8 oz.) Durkee Red Hot Sauce (trust me!)
2  Tbsp. butter or margarine
1  Tbsp. garlic wine vinegar
1  Tbsp. honey
1  Tbsp. lemon juice
  2-3 pkgs. chicken wing drumettes

      Put first 5 ingredients in a sauce pan and simmer on low until it is all melted/mixed well. Keep warm while doing the chicken.
      Deep fry the chicken in peanut oil at 350 degrees until golden brown and floating. Drain the batches on paper towels in a warm oven. They should be brown and crispy. When all the chicken is done put them in a large bowl and pour the sauce on them. Toss to coat all the pieces.
