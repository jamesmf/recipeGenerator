SPICY CHRISTMAS PICKLES


1  gal. jar dill pickles
5  lb. bag sugar
1  bottle Louisiana hot sauce
3  garlic cloves, chopped

      Drain juice from pickles and discard. Slice pickles into spears and put in jar. Add hot sauce, garlic and 1/3 of sugar. Screw on lid tightly. Gently mix pickles with sugar and spices by tipping jar back and forth. Leave on counter at room temperature for 1 week. As sugar dissolves, add more sugar until all sugar is used. Mix pickles daily. Pickles will be dark green when all sugar is absorbed.
