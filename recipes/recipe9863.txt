1  lb. sausage
1/2  onion, chopped
2  c. cabbage, chopped and cooked
  salt to taste
2  c. White Sauce

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Butter a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. Cook sausage in skillet, breaking it up with a fork as it cooks. When no pink is showing, transfer sausage to a bowl.  Place chopped onions to the sausage drippings and cook until limp.  Drain and add to sausage and mix well.  Spread the meat mixture in the bottom of casserole dish.  Cover with cabbage leaves.  Add salt.  Pour White Sauce over mixtures and bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until bubbling hot.
White Sauce:
2  Tbsp. butter
2  Tbsp. flour
1  c. milk, heated
  salt
  freshly ground pepper

      Melt butter in heavy bottom saucepan. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until a paste forms and it bubbles a bit, but don't let it brown, about 2 minutes. Add milk continuing to stir as the sauce thickens. Bring to a boil. Add salt and pepper to taste. Lower heat and cook, stirring 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from heat. You may cool this sauce for later use. Cover with wax paper if saving.
