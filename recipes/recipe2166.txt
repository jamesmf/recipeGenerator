CRESCENT VEGGIE APPETIZER TREE


2 (8 oz.)  cans refrigerated crescent dinner rolls
1 (8 oz.)  pkg. cream cheese, softened
1/2  c. sour cream
1  tsp. dried dill weed
1/8  tsp. garlic powder
3  c. finely chopped assorted vegetables, such as bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, cucumber and/or green onion

      Heat oven to 375 degrees;.  Remove dough from cans in rolled sections (two sections from each can); do not unroll.  Cut each section into 8 slices (16 slices from each can).  Place slices, cut side down, on ungreased cookie sheets to form two trees.  To form each tree, start by placing 1 slice for top; arrange 2 slices just below, with sides touching.  Continue arranging in a row of 3 slices, then a new row of 4 slices, ending with a row of 5 slices.  Use remaining slice for trunk.  Refrigerate one tree.
      Bake one tree at 375 degrees; for 11 to 14 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool 1 minute; carefully loosen with spatula and slide onto wire rack to cool.  Prepare second tree, bake and cool.  Place each tree on a platter.  In small bowl, combine cream cheese, sour cream, dill and garlic powder; blend until smooth.  Spread the mixture over both trees.  Decorate the trees with assorted vegetable pieces.  Garnish if desired.  Refrigerate until serving time.  To serve, just pull apart the slices of the tree.  Makes 2 trees; 32 appetizers.
