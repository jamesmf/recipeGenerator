Marinade and Chicken:
1 1/2  c. buttermilk
1/4  c. frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed
2 1/2  Tbsp. white wine vinegar
1  tsp. salt
3/4  tsp. black pepper
1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper
1  (3 1/4 lb.) chicken, cut into 10 pieces (2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings, each breast half cut into 2 pieces; backbone discarded)

 
Coating:
1  c. all-purpose flour
2  Tbsp. cornstarch
2  tsp. salt
1  tsp. black pepper
  vegetable oil (for frying)

      Marinade and Chicken: In large bowl, whisk buttermilk, juice concentrate, vinegar, salt, black pepper and cayenne. Add chicken. Cover; refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight.
      Coating: In large plastic food storage bag, combine coating ingredients. Drain chicken. Place 2 pieces at a time in flour mixture; shake to coat all over. Place on rack set over piece of waxed paper. Let chicken stand at room temperature 30 minutes to set coating.
      In large cast-iron skillet (12 to 14-inches), heat 1 1/2-inches of oil over medium heat until it registers 340 degrees; on deep-fat frying thermometer. Fry chicken, a few pieces at a time, until golden brown (wings and thighs take 10 to 12 minutes; drumsticks and breast pieces take 8 to 10 minutes). Drain on paper towels. Makes 4 servings.
