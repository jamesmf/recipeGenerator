BEEF STROGANOFF


1  lb. boneless sirloin
1  Tbsp. vegetable oil
1  c. thinly sliced onions
1  garlic clove, minced
2  c. thinly sliced mushrooms
1/4  c. flour
1/4  c. chopped parsley
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
1  c. beef broth
2  Tbsp. tomato paste
1  Tbsp. cornstarch
2/3  c. nonfat yogurt

      Trim fat from the beef; slice beef into thin strips, about 2-inches long. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet. Add beef and cook over high heat until meat is lightly browned; add onions, garlic and mushrooms. Cook over medium heat until onions are soft. Remove from heat. Stir in flour, parsley, salt and pepper. Gradually add beef broth and tomato paste. Cook over medium heat until mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Remove from heat.
       In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of yogurt, then stir in remaining yogurt. Stir yogurt into meat mixture; simmer over low heat 3 to 4 minutes. If mixture is too thick, add additional broth. Makes  6 servings.
Tips:

      Adding cornstarch to the yogurt helps stabilize it to prevent curdling.
      Serve over hot cooked noodles accompanied by asparagus, combination salad and crusty bread.
