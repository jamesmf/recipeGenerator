ORIENTAL SALAD DRESSING


1/2  c. sugar
1/2  c. white vinegar
1  c. oil
2  flavor beef packets

      Dressing is best if prepared the night before so it will have time to marinate. Shake it several times that day. Pour dressing over salad when you are ready to serve it; this is necessary. This will keep the salad from becoming soggy.
