TWENTY-FOUR HOUR SALAD


1  1/2 head lettuce, chopped
1  c. carrots, sliced
1  c. onions, chopped
1 small  box frozen peas
1  c. radishes, sliced
1  c. green peppers, chopped
1  c. cucumbers, sliced
8  strips bacon
1  c. shredded cheese
  boiled eggs, sliced (optional)
1  pt. mayonnaise
2  Tbsp. sugar

      Bring  water  to  a boil.  Take off burner.  Put frozen peas in  and  let  set  10  minutes.  Drain.  Using a tall 9 x 13-inch pan, put lettuce and vegetables in, in layers.
      Mix  sugar  in  mayonnaise  and spread on top as if you were icing  a  cake.  Spread  cheese  on  top.  When ready to serve, put  fried bacon crumbles or bacon bits on top.  If you use eggs, put them in layers with the vegetables.
      This is best made 24 hours ahead and kept in refrigerator.
