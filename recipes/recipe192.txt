NORTH CAROLINA COOKIES


1  Tbsp. butter
3/8  c. granulated sugar
1  egg
1  c. flour
1  tsp. baking powder
  sprinkle of salt
1  tsp. vanilla
1  c. well-washed currants

      Combine first 7 ingredients; mix well.  Stir in currants.  This dough is very soft.  It's a good idea to chill it.  Divide into sections and roll thin.  Cut.  Grease electric frypan lightly.  Set at 250 degrees; and bake 5 minutes on each side.  Be careful because they burn easily.
