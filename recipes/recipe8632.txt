BAKED TUNA CHOW MEIN CASSEROLE


1  C. chopped celery
1/4  C. chopped onion
2  Tbsp. chopped green pepper
1  Tbsp. butter
7  oz. can tuna
10 3/4  oz. cream of mushroom soup-thinned with 1/4 C. water and 1/4 C. milk)
3  oz. (1 1/3 C.) chow mein noodles
3/4  C. (4 oz.) salted cashew nuts

      Mix all ingredients except chow mein noodles and nuts.
      Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until bubbly.
      Just before serving mix in the chow mein noodles and nuts.
      I always save a few noodles to sprinkle on the top.
