      Place the TVP in small heatproof mixing bowl and pour the boiling water over it.  Mix well and set aside.  Fill a 4 1/2-quart saucepan 2/3 full of water.  Bring to a rolling boil.  Cook the pasta in it until it is al dent.  Drain the pasta well and return it to the saucepan.  Cover the saucepan with a lid and set it aside.
      Meanwhile, heat the oil in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add onion and garlic and saut them for 10 minutes.  Then add the mushrooms and rehydrated TVP and saut for 5 minutes longer.  Stir in remaining ingredients and bring the sauce to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer the sauce, uncovered, for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Pour the sauce over the reserved pasta in the saucepan.  Toss in together well and serve at once.  Yields 3 servings.
