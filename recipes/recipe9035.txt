CHICKEN PARISIENNE


6  medium chicken breasts
1/2  c. dry white wine
1  can cream of mushroom soup
1 (3 oz.)  can sliced mushrooms, drained (I use "fresh")
  paprika
1  c. dairy sour cream
  hot cooked rice

      Place chicken skin side up in a 12 x 7 x 1/2 x 2-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with salt. Blend wine into mushroom soup. Add mushrooms and pour over chicken. Bake at 350 degrees; for 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Remove chicken to platter. Sprinkle with paprika. Pour sauce from baking dish into saucepan. Blend in sour cream and heat gently until hot. Serve chicken with hot cooked rice and top with sauce.
