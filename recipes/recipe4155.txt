BAKED BRIE


15  oz. Brie cheese
1/4  c. butter, softened
6  dried tomato halves, reconstituted in hot water
1 small  clove garlic, minced
1/4  c. chopped, toasted walnuts
2  tsp. chopped parsley

      Chill Brie in freezer until firm (not frozen), about 1 hour. With sharp knife, halve cheese horizontally; set aside.
      Beat butter, then beat in tomatoes and garlic.  Mix in walnuts.  Spread tomato mixture on cut side of one cheese half. Cover with remaining cheese, cut side down; press gently.  Roll cheese on its side in parsley to coat tomato layer.  Cover and chill until firm.  (May be wrapped and frozen for 1 week.) Cut into thin slices.  Serve with crackers or baguette slices.  Makes 8 to 10 appetizers.
