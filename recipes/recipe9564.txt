CHICKEN WITH BALSAMIC VINEGAR


1  whole chicken, cut in 8 parts, skinned, but not boned
1/4  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. pepper
2  bell peppers (red and green)
10  oz. sliced mushrooms
1  onion, halved, then sliced
2  cloves garlic, minced
1/3  c. hot pepper sauce
1/4  c. balsamic vinegar
1  tsp. brown sugar

      Coat large nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Season chicken with salt and pepper.  Brown chicken 5 to 8 minutes over medium-high heat; remove to plate and keep warm.  Recoat skillet with cooking spray. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook peppers, mushrooms, onion and garlic until peppers are crisp-tender, 5 to 8 minutes.  Whisk together hot pepper sauce, vinegar and sugar.  Add to skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low.  Add chicken; cover and simmer, turning occasionally, until chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. Serves 4.
