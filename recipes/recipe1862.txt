TEX-MEX SALSA


1  Tbsp. vegetable oil
1  large onion, chopped (about 1 c.)
1 large  clove garlic, crushed
1 (16 oz.)  can whole tomatoes, well drained
1 (4 oz.)  can mild green chilies, drained and chopped
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. freshly ground black pepper

      In 8-inch skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil; add onion and garlic.  Cook 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently until onion is crisp-tender.  Remove from heat; cool slightly.
      Meanwhile in medium sized bowl, combine tomatoes, chilies, salt and pepper.  Add onion and garlic to bowl; stir well to mix, breaking up any large chunks of tomato.  Makes about 2 1/2 cups (1/4 cup per serving).
