HAMBURGER PIE


1  lb. lean ground beef
1/2  c. chopped onion
1/2  tsp. salt
  Dash pepper
1  can (16-oz.) cut green beans, drained
1  can (10 3/4-oz.) condensed tomato soup
5  hot cooked medium potatoes*
1/2  c. warm milk
1  egg, beaten
1/2  c. process American cheese, shredded

      In large skillet, cook meat and onion till meat is lightly browned and onion is tender.  Add salt and pepper.  Add drained beans and undiluted soup; pour into greased 2-quart casserole. Mash potatoes while still hot; add milk and egg.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spoon in mounds over casserole.  Sprinkle potatoes with cheese.  Bake in 350 degrees; oven for 25 to 30 minutes.  Serves 4 to 6.
      *Or prepare 4 servings packaged instant mashed potatoes according to package directions except reserve the milk.  Add egg and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Add enough reserved milk so potatoes are stiff enough to hold shape.
