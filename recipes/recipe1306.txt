VEGETARIAN MEATBALLS


6  to 8 carrots
1  c. chopped onion
1 1/2  c. water
1  Tbsp. tamari
1 1/2  c. TVP
1 1/2  c. sunflower seeds, finely ground
3  Tbsp. olive oil
1  Tbsp. olive oil
1  c. finely chopped zucchini
1  vegetable bouillon cube
2  tsp. curry powder
3  green onions, finely chopped
1/2  tsp. sea salt

      Cut the greens off the carrots.  Juice the carrots and reserve 2 cups of the pulp.  In a large skillet, heat the 1 tablespoon olive oil over low heat.  Add the onion and zucchini and saut until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.  In a small saucepan over high heat, boil the water.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the bouillon cube, tamari and curry.  When the cube is dissolved, stir the hot broth.  In a large bowl, combine the hot broth and TVP.  Let the mixture sit until the TVP is hydrated (10 minutes).  Add the pulp and sunflower seeds and mix with spoon or hands.  Add the saut√©d vegetables and green onion and mix again.  Mix in salt.  Pinch off a small piece of the mixture and form balls.  In a large skillet, pour in just enough of the remaining oil to coat the bottom.  Add the meatballs and cook them over low heat, turning to keep them from sticking, until golden brown on all sides, for 12 minutes.  Remove from skillet with a slotted spoon.
