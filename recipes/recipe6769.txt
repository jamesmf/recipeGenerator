WHOLE PORK LOIN SANDWICHES


  whole pork loins
  buns (figure 1/4 lb. pork per sandwich)
1  case Budweiser

      Cut the whole pork loins in half to make them easier to handle. Sample the beer. Put each piece (fat side up) on aluminum foil large enough to wrap it up. Sample the beer. Sprinkle with ground pepper, salt and garlic powder. Sample the beer. Squirt with your favorite mustard, 3 or 4 stripes lengthwise. Sample the beer. Wrap with foil and then double wrap. Put in a deep roasting pan. Sample the beer. Cook in 300 degrees; oven for 2 to 3 1/2 hours or until center is 180 degrees;. Sample many beers; this takes awhile. Unwrap cooked meat but save the juices.
       Cook on a grill until they get the amount of charring you desire. This is just adding that grilled flavor; the meat is already done. This process may take several beers.
      Cut into 2-inch slices and pull apart. Put into roaster along with juices and a can or so of beer. Add 1 large bottle of K.C. Masterpiece barbecue sauce per roaster of meat. Serve on buns with additional barbecue sauce available and any beer that may be leftover.
       NOTE: Depending on the cook, more beer may be necessary.
