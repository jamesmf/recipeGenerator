5  carrots, sliced
1  pkg. pitted prunes
1/2  box raisins
5  apples, sliced
  salt to taste
1/2 to 3/4  c. flour

      Put duck in kettle with enough water to cover.  Heat to boiling.  Remove scum from surface of broth.  Put in the next 8 ingredients; cook until duck, vegetables and fruit are done. Remove duck from kettle.  Take meat off bones and put meat back in soup.  Combine 1/2 to 3/4 cup flour and enough cream to make a thin paste.  Add this mixture to soup and let simmer.  The soup will get thicker.  A little sugar or vinegar can be added for taste.  Serve with egg noodles.
