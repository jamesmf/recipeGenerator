QUICK STROGANOFF


1  1/2 lbs. top round steak, boneless
2  Tbsp. cooking oil
4  oz. can sliced mushrooms, undrained
1  pkg. dry onion soup mix
1  C. sour cream
2  Tbsp. flour

      Cut meat diagonally across grain into strips 1/4-inch thick. Heat cooking oil in skillet and brown meat quickly.  Drain off oil.
      Add 2/3 C. water and mushrooms with liquid.  Stir in dry soup mix and heat just to boiling.  Blend sour cream and flour and add to mixture in skillet.  Simmer (do not boil), stirring until mixture thickens (sauce will be rather thin).
      Serve immediately over hot noodles.
