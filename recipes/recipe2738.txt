PANORAMIC EASTER EGG
(Great Project With Kids!)  

5  c. sugar
1  egg white

      Mix sugar and unbeaten egg white until thoroughly blended (consistency of wet sand).  Wash plastic egg mold (large size that is divided lengthwise); dry carefully and dust with cornstarch to be sure it's completely dry.  Fill both halves of mold with sugar mixture and unmold gently onto breadboard.  Let dry until it is firm enough to handle, about 2 to 3 hours.
      Scoop out inside (use remaining sugar to make additional eggs). Slice off small end for viewing.  Fasten grass and centerpiece (picture of your choice of selected scene) with Royal Frosting in bottom of egg.  Let dry until secure.
      Put top and bottom together with Royal Frosting.  Cut piece of plastic to fill over viewing hole.  Decorate seams, view opening and top using the Royal Frosting and cake decorator.
      Royal Frosting:  Mix together powdered sugar, cream of tartar and a very small amount of milk to form a thick paste of consistency to work with pastry decorator.
