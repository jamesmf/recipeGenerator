BASTING SAUCE


1  c. chopped Spanish onion
2/3  c. olive oil
3/4  c. water
3/4  c. catsup
1/3  c. lemon juice
4  Tbsp. sugar
4  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
2  Tbsp. prepared mustard
2  tsp. freshly ground pepper
1/4  tsp. ground celery leaf
1/4  tsp. Tabasco sauce

      Saut√© onion in olive oil until tender.  Just as onion begins to turn brown, add the remaining ingredients and simmer for about 10 minutes.
      This sauce is good used as a basting sauce for chicken, turkey, Cornish hens and hamburger.  A special treat when used with an extra thick cut of sirloin.  The extra sauce is good over baked potatoes.
