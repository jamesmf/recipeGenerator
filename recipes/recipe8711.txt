TURKEY GUMBO


1  turkey carcass
1  c. flour
1  stick butter
1  large bell pepper, chopped
1  large onion, chopped
1  rib celery, chopped
4  cloves garlic, chopped
  sliced andouille (or other smoked sausage)
  red pepper and salt to taste

	In a large pot, boil the turkey carcass.  Remove from broth and debone.  Set aside along with any leftover turkey.
	In a microwave-safe bowl, prepare roux by cooking the flour in the microwave  for 2 minutes.  Stir and continue to microwave in 1 minute increments stopping to stir frequently to prevent roux from burning or getting hot spots, continuing this process until flour turns dark tan.  If you burn and get hard black pieces, you can remove with spoon and the rest of the roux will be okay.
	In a saucepan, melt the butter and saut√© the bell pepper, onion, celery and garlic.  Add this mixture to the broth and stir well. Add sausage, reduce heat and simmer for 2 to 4 hours. About 20 to 30 minutes before you are ready to serve, add the turkey, pepper and salt.   Cook until well heated. Serve with file.
