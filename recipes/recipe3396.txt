CHEESE PECAN WAFERS


1  stick butter (room temperature)
2  c. grated sharp cheddar cheese
1 1/2  c. all purpose flour
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper
1/2  c. pecans (finely chopped)

      Using an electric mixer, combine all ingredients to make a soft dough.  Divide into quarters, and roll each piece into a log about 1 inch in diameter.  Wrap in waxed paper, and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours.
      Heat oven to 350 degrees;.  Unwrap dough and cut into slices about 1/4 inch thick.  Arrange slices on a non-stick baking sheet.  Bake until edges are brown, about 20 minutes.
      Yield: 8 dozen wafers.
