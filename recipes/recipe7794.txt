LEMON-PEPPER CATFISH


4  to 6 fresh catfish filets
1 1/2  c. all-purpose flour
1/2  c. cornmeal
1  Tbsp. lemon-pepper
4  large eggs
1/2  stick margarine
  salt and pepper to taste

      Combine flour, cornmeal and lemon-pepper and set aside. Beat eggs in another bowl and set aside. Dip filets in eggs and then in flour mixture until well coated; you may dip twice. Melt butter in a large skillet (electric skillets work great). Add 2 to 4 filets at a time. Cook, turning until brown on both sides.
