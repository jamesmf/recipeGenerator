BECKY'S HOT SAUCE


2  large white onions
  fresh jalapenos
1  Tbsp. minced garlic
  salt to taste
2 large  cans whole tomatoes
  cilantro (optional)
2  c. water

      In large pot, cut up onions and only cut stems off jalapenos. It depends on how many jalapenos you use as to how hot you want it. Add the water and boil until onions and jalapenos are soft, approximately 15 minutes. Drain water. Add tomatoes, garlic, salt and cilantro. Return to heat for approximately 15 minutes. Remove and put in blender to chop up. Makes approximately 6 pints.
