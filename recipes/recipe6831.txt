1 (16 oz.)  jar taco sauce
1 (12 oz.)  can Hungry Jack biscuits
6  oz. shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
6  oz. Monterey Jack cheese
1/4  c. chopped green peppers
1/4  c. chopped onions
1/2  lb. ground beef

      Season and brown ground beef. Add green peppers and onions. Set this aside.
      Spread half of the taco sauce in bottom of lightly greased 9 x 13 pan.
      Cut each biscuit into 4 pieces. Place in pan and "toss" them lightly to coat them with taco sauce. Sprinkle beef mixture and shredded cheese (about half) over top and "toss" gently. Bake at 400 degrees; for 15 to 20 minutes. It should brown slightly. Add remaining beef mixture on top and cover with remaining cheese. Bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.
