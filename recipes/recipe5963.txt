BEAN SOUP


2  c. white navy beans (soaked overnight)
  a hambone (with some meat still on it)
2  medium onions (chopped fine)
1  clove garlic (minced)
1/2  c. chopped parsley
1/2  tsp. coarse black pepper
1  tsp. M.S.G.
2  or 3 carrots (chopped fine)
4  stalks celery with tops (chopped fine)

      Simmer the hambone and soaked beans in 3 qts. water for 2 hours.  Add the rest of ingredients and simmer 1 hour longer. Remove hambone: chop pieces of meat and return to soup.  Mash beans if needed to thicken soup.
