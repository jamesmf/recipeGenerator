HOT TAMALES


2  lb. ground meat
1/2  tsp. red pepper
2  tsp. garlic powder
6  medium onions, blended
2  tsp. cayenne pepper
8  tsp. salt
2  tsp. oregano
1  (2 oz.) chili powder
1/2  c. water
1/2  c. yellow corn meal or masa
1  can tomato sauce
2  tsp. cumin powder
2  tsp. paprika

	Put all ingredients in large bowl and mix well by hand.  Take about 1 tablespoon at a time.  Roll in yellow corn meal or masa. Wrap in papers.  Wet papers first so they will not be stiff.  Take string and tie 3 tamales together at a time.  Put tamales in large roasting pan.  Pour boiling water to completely cover all the tamales.  To the pot, add 1 can tomato sauce and 1 ounce chili powder.  Cover and simmer for 2 hours.
