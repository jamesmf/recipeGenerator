HAWAIIAN MACARONI SALAD
(Dessert)  

1  lb. orzo macaroni (looks like rice)
3/4  c. sugar
1/2  Tbsp. flour
2 large (15 1/2 oz.)  cans pineapple chunks or tidbits
2 small  cans mandarin oranges
1 large  jar maraschino cherries
1  bag miniature marshmallows
1  (16 oz.) tub thawed whipped topping
2  eggs, slightly beaten
1/2  tsp. salt

      Separate fruit from juice.  Save both while cooking macaroni. Prepare the fruit sauce.  Mix sugar, flour, salt, eggs and juice in saucepan.  Cook to a boil; remove from heat.  The sauce will thicken as it cools.  Mix sauce with drained macaroni in a large bowl.  Mix well and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Next day, fold in fruit, marshmallows and topping.  Chill until ready to serve.  Makes 6 quarts.  Good for a crowd.
