BLUEBERRY-OAT BRAN MUFFINS


2 1/4  c. oat bran
1  c. whole wheat flour
4  tsp. baking powder
  pinch of salt
1  c. fresh blueberries or frozen blueberries, thawed and drained
2  eggs
1/2  c. nonfat milk
1  ripe banana, mashed
1/2  c. frozen apple juice concentrate, thawed
3  Tbsp. vegetable oil
2  Tbsp. molasses

      Preheat the oven to 400 degrees;.  Coat a 12-cup muffin tin with vegetable cooking spray or line with paper muffin cups.  In a large mixing bowl, gently mix the dry ingredients with blueberries to prevent the blueberries from sinking into the batter by coating them.
      In a separate bowl, mix the remaining ingredients.  Whisk until smooth.  Add the wet ingredients to the dry.  Stir until just combined but not overmixed and fill the prepared muffin cups 3/4 full.  Place in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden.  Remove the muffins from the pan; allow to cool slightly and serve warm.  Makes 1 dozen.
