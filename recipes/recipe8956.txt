CREAMY CHICKEN SPAGHETTI


1  hen
1  can cream of celery soup
1  small bell pepper
  chopped mushrooms to taste
1 (16 oz.)  pkg. spaghetti
1  can cream of mushroom soup
1  medium onion, chopped

1  lb. Velveeta cheese

      Cook hen until tender, adding salt and pepper to taste. Cook and debone. Boil spaghetti in broth.
      Meanwhile, simmer chopped onion and bell pepper in a little broth. When spaghetti is tender, but not too soft, remove from heat. Add chopped chicken, soups, pimento, mushrooms and onion and pepper mixture. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, being careful not to scorch. Add Velveeta, which has been cut into small pieces. Cover; let stand for about 2 hours before serving.
