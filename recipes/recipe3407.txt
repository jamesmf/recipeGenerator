MARINATED PARTY VEGETABLES



1  small cauliflower, cut into cauliflowerettes
1  lb. mushrooms
2  green peppers, cut into strips
18  black olives, pitted

 
Dressing:
1  c. olive oil
1 1/2  c. wine vinegar
1  tsp. salt
3/4  tsp. pepper
1  clove garlic, minced
4  Tbsp. sugar

      Mix all dressing ingredients together; bring to a boil, cool. Pour over vegetables and marinate overnight.  Serve on lettuce-lined tray with toothpicks.
      Variation:  Add other favorite vegetables, such as broccoli, carrot sticks, red or yellow peppers.  Mix colors on the tray for a festive look.  Red, green and white vegetables are especially pretty at Christmas parties.
