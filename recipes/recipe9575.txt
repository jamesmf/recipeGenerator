TUSCAN CHICKEN AND PASTA


4  medium, boneless chicken breasts
2  egg whites
  fine bread crumbs
  grated Parmesan cheese
2  Tbsp. olive oil
1  medium chopped onion
1/4  c. sun-dried tomatoes, reconstituted in olive oil*
2  c. sliced mushrooms (white and/or combination)
1  can artichoke hearts
1  c. chicken broth
1  Tbsp. basil
1/4  c. Greek olives, cut in half
1  tsp. lemon zest
  angel hair pasta
  chopped parsley

      Mix equal amounts of bread crumbs and cheese (enough to dredge chicken breasts).  Mix egg whites with a few drops of water and pinch of salt.  Dip chicken breasts in egg whites and then dredge in bread crumb mixture.  Sauté in olive oil until browned on outside, but not cooked through. Remove and keep warm. Add more oil, if needed, to sauté onions until soft.  Add sun-dried tomatoes with their oil, mushrooms and artichoke hearts.  Stir and toss until mushrooms wilt.  Add chicken broth, basil, olives and zest and return chicken to pot. Simmer, covered, until chicken is cooked through and sauce is hot. Serve over angel hair pasta and sprinkle with chopped parsley.  Serves 4.
      *Slice tomatoes in strips and microwave for 1 minute in 1/4 cup olive oil in covered cup.  Let sit for 10 minutes to soften.
