WALNUT CHICKEN


1 1/3  lb. whole chicken breasts
3  Tbsp. soy sauce
2  tsp. cornstarch
2  Tbsp. chicken broth
1  tsp. each grated ginger root and sugar
1/2  tsp. each salt and crushed red pepper
2  Tbsp. cooking oil
2  medium green peppers, cut into 3/4 inch pieces
4  green onions, bias-sliced into 1 inch lengths

      Skin, halve and bone chicken breasts.  Cut chicken into 1 inch pieces.  In a small bowl stir soy sauce into cornstarch; stir in chicken broth, ginger root, sugar, salt and red pepper.  Set aside. Preheat a wok over high heat; add cooking oil.  Stir-fry green peppers and green onions in hot oil for 2 minutes or until crisp-tender.  Remove from wok.  Add walnuts to wok; stir-fry 1 to 2 minutes or until just golden.  Remove from wok.  Add half of the chicken to the hot wok; stir-fry 2 minutes.  Remove from wok. Stir-fry remaining chicken 2 minutes.  Return all chicken to wok. Stir soy mixture into chicken.  Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly.  Stir in vegetables and walnuts; cover and cook 1 minute more.  Serve chicken and vegetables at once with hot cooked rice. Garnish with whole red peppers and fresh cilantro, if desired.
