BELGIAN STEAMED MUSSELS


3  Tbsp. unsalted butter
2  big shallots
2  ribs celery, chopped
4 to 6  lb. fresh thyme
1  bay leaf
2  Tbsp. parsley, finely chopped
  black pepper and a little bit of salt
1  c. Belgian beer, Geuze or a strong Duvel

      Melt the butter in a pot and add the shallots and the celery. Cook, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.  Add the mussels, thyme, bay leaf, parsley, pepper and salt.  Pour the beer over the mussels and cover the pot.  Bring them to a boil over high heat and steam the mussels until they are opening.  It will take about 4 minutes.  Be careful not to overcook the mussels, otherwise they will be tough.  Shake the pot several times to toss the mussels with the vegetables.  Spoon the hot mussels into soup plates along with some broth.  Sprinkle with a little bit of parsley just before serving.
      Note:  In Belgium, we serve French fries or bread with mussels and to drink there is nothing better than a Belgian beer with mussels.
