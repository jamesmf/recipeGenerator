CHICKEN AND SAUSAGE GUMBO


4  lb. boneless chicken, cut in large chunks
  salt, pepper and cayenne to taste
1/3  c. cooking oil
1  large onion, chopped
2  ribs celery, finely chopped
1  bell pepper, chopped
2 large  cloves garlic, minced
2/3  c. flour
  water to bring to soup consistency
1/3  c. dry red wine
3/4  lb. smoked andouille sausage, sliced
1  pt. oysters, drained and rinsed (optional)
  parsley, chopped
1  Tbsp. gumbo file (powdered seasoning)
4  c. cooked rice

	Cut up the chicken and season generously with salt, pepper and cayenne. In a heavy pot, fry the chicken in oil until golden brown. Remove the oil and reserve it for making the roux.  Add the onion, celery, bell pepper and garlic to the chicken. Cover and cook over low heat.
	Make a dark roux using 1/2 cup of the reserved oil and the flour.  Mix together in a small saucepan and stir over low heat for 30 minutes until a brown color is attained.  Do not stop stirring even for a few seconds or the flour will scorch and you will have to start over.  The roux is the heart of the gumbo.  Cool the roux before adding to the chicken.  Continue cooking over low heat, adding water in small amounts.  Add the wine.  When the chicken is fork tender, add the andouille.  Add the oysters and parsley 10 minutes before serving and add the file.  (File may be placed on the table and added to taste.)
	Serve in heated bowls.	Fill half the bowl with cooked rice. Pour ladle of gumbo over rice.  Do not add the rice to the gumbo or it will get soft and soggy.
