EASY CHEESY BEEF ENCHILADAS
(20 Minutes To Make)  

1  lb. lean ground beef
1  pkg. taco seasoning
1  c. water
  flour tortillas
  canned salsa con queso (we like the Taco Bell brand)
  shredded Colby or Cheddar cheese

      Brown the beef in a large skillet. Drain the meat. Mix in the taco seasoning. Add the water and simmer over low heat. Place 3 to 4 tablespoons of meat in each flour tortilla. Roll and place seam down in a glass pan. Continue until all meat is gone and pan is full. Then top with salsa con queso and cheese. Microwave 6 to 8 minutes. Serve with hot sauce, chips, beans and fresh tomatoes, if they like 'em. Serves 6 to 8.
