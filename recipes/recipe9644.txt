STUFFED CHICKEN BREAST WITH CRAB


8  boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1  lb. crab meat
2  eggs
1 1/2  Tbsp. mayonnaise
1  tsp. prepared mustard
1  tsp. dry mustard
1  Tbsp. dried parsley
1  tsp. celery seed
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. oregano
1  pkg. toothpicks
2  egg whites, beaten
1 1/2  c. corn flakes, crushed

      *If you choose to leave out the mayonnaise, you can substitute it for melted cheese of your choice. I prefer Colby Jack cheese.
      Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Flatten chicken breasts with a meat mallet. In a bowl, combine crab, eggs mayonnaise, prepared mustard, dry mustard, dried parsley, celery seed, salt, and oregano; mix well. Spoon onto the chicken breasts and roll to enclose the filling; secure with toothpicks. Dip rolled breasts into beaten egg whites and roll in crushed corn flakes. Bake for 1 hour, or until chicken is tender.
