PICKLED BEETS


  beets
1  tsp. salt
2 scant  c. sugar
2  c. vinegar
2  c. water
  cloves

      Boil beets until tender. Blanch with cold water and the skins will slip off. Make syrup by boiling together water, vinegar, sugar and salt. Add a few whole cloves to boiling syrup, but leave them out of the beets as they tend to leave dark spots. Add a pinch of black pepper. Bring syrup to a good boil and add slices or whole beets. Bring to boil again and put into sterilized jars and seal.
