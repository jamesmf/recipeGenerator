7 LAYER SALAD


1  head lettuce, cut up small
1  large onion, finely chopped
1  pkg. frozen green peas
1  c. mayonnaise
1/4  c. sugar
5  hard-boiled eggs
2  c. shredded Cheddar cheese
1  c. real bacon bits or 1/2 lb. bacon, fried extra crispy

      In large glass bowl (diameter at top and bottom of bowl must be same as this salad is to be served straight down from top to bottom so all layers are served to each person), put approximately 4-inches of lettuce for bottom layer.  This may or may not take the full head of lettuce.  Spread onion over lettuce for 2nd layer. Spread green peas over onion for 3rd layer.  Mix mayonnaise and sugar; beat until smooth and spread over peas for 4th layer.  Cut boiled eggs in round slices and cover dressing layer for the 5th layer.  Cover eggs with shredded cheese for the 6th layer.  Cover the entire salad with bacon for the 7th layer.  This salad should be sealed with Saran Wrap and refrigerated for 24 hours to allow the flavor of each layer to go through the salad.
