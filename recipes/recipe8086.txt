ERNIE'S STOVE TOP MEATLOAF


1  lb. ground chuck
2  cans stewed tomatoes
1  lb. ground pork (or sausage)
1  can diced tomatoes
1/2  c. salsa
1  c. cracker crumbs
1  egg
  salt and pepper

	Mix meat loaf ingredients.  Shape into a loaf in a large skillet.  Pour sauce ingredients around and over loaf.  Cook on top of stove until done (I cook on medium for close to 1 hour). The tomatoes make a wonderful gravy.  Serve with mashed potatoes or rice.
