STRAWBERRY SWIZZLE


2  c. unsweetened partly thawed strawberries
2  c. orange juice
2 (12 oz.)  cans chilled strawberry soda
1 (12 oz.)  can chilled lemon-lime soda

      In blender, combine orange juice and strawberries.  Blend until pureed.  Put into a large pitcher and pour both sodas down the side of the pitcher, stirring gently.  Garnish with berries.  This can be made using sugar-free sodas and is very good for diabetic or other diets.  Serves 8.
