1  (3 lb.) fryer
4  medium onions
1 1/2  qt. fresh or frozen butter beans
3  or 4 medium potatoes
  okra (optional)
1  qt. corn
1  qt. or more tomato juice
  salt and pepper to taste
  red pepper to taste
2  cans alphabet soup, undiluted

      Boil chicken and onions until tender meat can be removed from bones. While chicken cools, add beans, potatoes, and okra to broth and cook for 45 minutes. Remove chicken from bones; remove skin and chop chicken into small pieces. Add to beans along with corn and tomato juice. (Amount of juice depends upon the amount of chicken broth you have.) Season and simmer for at least another hour, adding the soup during the last 15 or 20 minutes of cooking time. Freezes well.
