MEXICAN ONE DISH MEAL


1  lb. extra lean ground beef or ground turkey
1  small onion, chopped
1  clove garlic, minced
1  green pepper, diced
2  medium potatoes, diced
1 (8 oz.)  can tomato sauce
2  cans (2 c.) water
2  tsp. chili powder
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. cumin
1/4  tsp. black pepper
1 (12 oz.)  can whole kernel corn, drained

      Cook ground beef or turkey and onion in large nonstick skillet. Stir occasionally while cooking. When meat is lightly browned and onion is soft, drain off fat. Add all remaining ingredients except corn. Cover and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Add more water if needed. Add corn; cook long enough to heat through. Makes 6 servings.
Tips:

      You may omit the corn.
      Serve with raw carrot and celery sticks.
      Scrub the potatoes well, but do not peel.
