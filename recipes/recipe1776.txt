VEAL BRAWN


2 1/2  lb. shoulder of veal
3.3  lb. shin of veal
2.1  qt. water
1 1/2  Tbsp. salt
1  bay leaf
15  white peppercorns
4  allspice (whole)
1  onion

      Divide the shoulder into two; rinse the shin and crack the bones if necessary.  Put the meat into a pot.  Add the water and bring slowly to a boil.  Skim off the scum.  Add the seasoning and onion and boil until the meat comes off the bone.  This takes about one hour.  Remove the meat and strain the liquid.
      Remove the meat from the bones.  Dice the best pieces and mince the rest in a mincer.  Put all the meat back into the pot and pour over the stock (there should be 1.5 quarts of liquid).  Bring the brawn to a boil.  Season to taste with extra spices and perhaps a little vinegar.  Pour the brawn into containers and let it set. Serve cold with pickled beet root.
