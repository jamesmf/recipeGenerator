SHRIMP BOIL DINNER


2  pkg. crab boil
6  lemons, halved
1  Tbsp. Tabasco sauce
2 to 3  Tbsp. ice cream salt
20  new potatoes
15  onions (unpeeled)
10  ears corn, shucked and halved
6  lb. fresh unpeeled shrimp

      In a large roaster half full of water, bring the crab boil, lemon halves, Tabasco and salt to a boil.  Add the new potatoes and onions and boil until the potatoes are tender.  Add corn.  When corn is tender, add the shrimp.  The shrimp are ready when they turn pink.  This will take only a few minutes after the water has come to a full boil again.  Drain and serve.  Yields 10 servings. Preparation time is 45 minutes.
