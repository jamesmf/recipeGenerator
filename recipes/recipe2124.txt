CHOCOLATE CRUNCHIES


2  Tbsp. peanut butter
2  Tbsp. vegetable shortening
1 2/3  c. M&M's plain chocolate candies
3  c. corn flakes

      Melt together peanut butter and shortening in 2 1/2-quart saucepan over low heat; add candies.  Cook over very low heat, stirring constantly with metal spoon and pressing candies with back of spoon to break up.  Chocolate will be almost melted and pieces of color coating will remain.  Remove from heat; add corn flakes, mixing until thoroughly coated.  Drop by rounded 1/2 teaspoonfuls onto greased cookie sheet.  Press one or two additional candies into mixture, if desired.  Let stand until set, about 30 minutes.
