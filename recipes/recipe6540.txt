CHILI


1  lb. ground beef or chuck
2  cans red kidney beans
1  can Great Northern beans
1  can chili beans
2  cans diced tomatoes
2  cans tomato sauce
1  yellow sweet onion
  chili powder
  garlic salt
  salt and pepper

      Brown meat and chopped onions; drain. Drain and rinse all beans EXCEPT chili beans. Combine all ingredients and add seasonings and salt and pepper to your taste. You may want to add water to desired thickness of the chili. Bring to medium heat and then simmer for a minimum of 30 minutes; the longer it simmers, the more the seasoning will be to its full potential.
       Other beans that are tasteful are black beans in this recipe.
