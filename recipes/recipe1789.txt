BREADED VEAL MILAN-STYLE


1/2  lb. veal scaloppine
  flour for dredging
  salt and freshly ground black pepper
1  egg
1  tsp. water
2  Tbsp. plus 1/2 tsp. peanut, vegetable or olive oil
1/4  tsp. grated nutmeg
3/4  c. fresh bread crumbs
1/4  c. grated Parmesan cheese
2  Tbsp. butter
2  to 4 lemon slices

      Unless the scaloppine are very small, cut them into pieces measuring about 3 x 3-inches or slightly larger.  Place them between sheets of wax paper and pound lightly to flatten, using the bottom of a heavy skillet or a flat mallet.  Season the flour with salt and pepper.  Beat the egg with the water, the 1/2 teaspoon of oil and nutmeg.  Blend the bread crumbs with Parmesan.  Dip the scaloppine on both sides first in flour, then in egg and finally in the bread crumb mixture.  As the scaloppine are breaded, place them on a flat surface and tap lightly to help the bread crumbs adhere. Heat the butter and remaining oil in a heavy skillet and add the scaloppine.  Cook until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes. Cook until golden brown on the other side.  Serve hot with sliced lemon.  Yield:  2 servings.
      Optional:  Garnish with capers and finely chopped hard-boiled egg whites and yolks.
