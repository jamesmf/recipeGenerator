PINEAPPLE SOUFFLE


1 (8 oz.)  can unsweetened crushed pineapple, drained (reserve juice)
1/3  c. sugar
2  Tbsp. cornstarch
2  egg yolks
1  tsp. vanilla extract
1/8  tsp. salt
6  egg whites
1/2  tsp. cream of tartar

      Add water to reserved pineapple juice to make 3/4 cup.  Combine with sugar and cornstarch in a saucepan.  Cook, stirring well, over medium heat until mixture thickens and comes to a boil.  Beat egg yolks, vanilla and salt with a wire whisk.  Gradually stir in 1/4 of the hot mixture, then add to the remaining hot mixture, stirring constantly.  Cook 1 minute.  Remove from heat and stir in pineapple.
      Beat egg whites and cream of tartar at high speed until stiff peaks form.  Stir 1/4 of mixture into pineapple mixture.  Gently fold remaining egg white mixture into pineapple mixture.  Spoon into a 2-quart (sprayed with vegetable cooking spray) souffle dish. Bake at 375 degrees; for 30 to 35 minutes or until puffed and golden. Serve immediately.  Makes 8 servings.
