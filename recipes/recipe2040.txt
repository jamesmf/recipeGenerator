CHERRY DIVINITY


2 1/2  c. sugar
3/4  c. water
1/2  c. light corn syrup
2  egg whites
1  tsp. vanilla extract
1  c. chopped walnuts
8  or 10 maraschino cherries, cut into small pieces

      Combine sugar, water, and corn syrup in a 2-quart saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring until sugar is completely dissolved.  Stop stirring; continue cooking until 260 degrees; on candy thermometer or until a small drop hardens when dropped in cold water.  Meanwhile, beat egg whites in small bowl until stiff peaks form.  Continue beating egg whites while pouring the hot syrup in a fine stream into the whites, blending well.  Add vanilla.  Beat until mixture holds its shape and becomes slightly dull (this may take several minutes).  Fold in nuts and cherries.  Quickly drop mixture from tip of a buttered teaspoon onto waxed paper.  Allow to dry for 2 or 3 hours.  Then store in airtight container.
      Tip:  To make divinity you must work fast without delays. Measure everything before starting.
