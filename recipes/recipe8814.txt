POPPY SEED CHICKEN


  chicken breasts
1/2  pt. sour cream
1  can cream of chicken and mushroom soup (comes together)
2 1/2  c. Ritz crackers, crushed
2  Tbsp. poppy seeds
1  stick oleo, melted

      Cut up fryer into pieces of desired size. Sprinkle liberally with salt and lemon pepper. Add 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper to 1 cup of flour in a paper bag; coat the chicken with the flour mixture. The true secret of taste is to give the seasoning time to take effect, so place the covered chicken pieces in the refrigerator for a couple of hours or more. Cook in a deep fat fryer in oil at 375 degrees;. Remove when golden brown and watch closely as small pieces will be ready earlier.
