SOUR CREAM POTATO SALAD


8  or 10 medium potatoes, boiled in jackets (I use red potatoes; they are moister and slice better)
1  cucumber, peeled and sliced thin
1  onion (sweet), sliced and separated into rings

 
Dressing:
1  c. Miracle Whip
1  c. sour cream
2  tsp. salt
  pepper to taste
2  tsp. celery seed
  dash of vinegar and Worcestershire sauce

      Boil potatoes until tender. Cool, peel and slice thin. Add to cucumber and onion.
       Make dressing; toss potatoes, cucumber, onion and dressing lightly. Chill.
       I think it is better if it sets overnight.
