FRENCH ONION SOUP


2  medium onions
2  Tbsp. butter
1  tsp. worcestershire sauce
2  Tbsp. cooking wine
4  c. beef broth
  french bread, sliced
  swiss cheese, shredded

      To a large pot add onions (peeled and thinly sliced) and butter.  Saut√© 8-10 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning.  Add broth, worcestershire sauce and wine.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.
      Meanwhile, slice french bread and top with swiss cheese. Broil until cheese is brown and bubbly.  Serve with bread floating on top of soup.
