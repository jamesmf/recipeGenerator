QUICK PICANTE DIP
(Simple, But Surprisingly Good!)  

1 (8 oz.)  pkg. Philadelphia cream cheese, softened
1 (8 oz.)  jar Pace Picante Sauce
  Cilantro for garnish

      Mix ingredients thoroughly and chill.  Garnish with cilantro sprig.  This is the basic recipe.  You can determine the "hot" factor of this dip by choosing mild, medium or hot Picante sauce. Also, the Picante sauce can be replaced with any good restaurant salsa or your own favorite salsa recipe.  If you really want to spice it up, add some fresh jalapeo pepper, chopped very fine.
