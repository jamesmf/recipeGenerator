MAPLE TERIYAKI SALMON FILLETS


1/3  c. apple juice
1/3  c. maple juice
3  Tbsp. soy sauce
2  Tbsp. finely chopped onion
2  garlic cloves, minced
4  salmon fillets (about 2 lb.)

      In a bowl, combine the first 5 ingredients. Remove 1/2 cup for basting. Cover and refrigerate. Pour remaining marinade into a large, resealable plastic bag. Add salmon. Seal bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 1 to 3 hours.
       Drain and discard marinade. Broil salmon 4-inches from the heat for 5 minutes. Baste with reserved marinade. Broil 10 minutes longer or until fish flakes easily with a fork, basting frequently. Yield: 4 servings.
