MINT ANGEL CAKE


8  egg whites
1/4  tsp. salt
1  tsp. cream of tartar
1  tsp. almond extract
1  tsp. vanilla
1 1/4  c. sugar
1  c. cake flour
1  box (3 1/2 c.)  Cool Whip or La Creme topping
1/2  c. coarsely crushed, hard mint candies

      Beat egg whites in a small mixing bowl until foamy.  Add salt and cream of tartar; beat until soft peaks form.  Fold in flavorings.  Gradually beat in sugar; continue beating until stiff. Sift cake flour into egg whites and fold in very gently.  Bake in an ungreased 10-inch tube pan at 325 degrees; for 50 to 60 minutes.
      Invert pan on a rack.  Cool thoroughly, then remove from pan and slice horizontally into 3 layers.  Place 1 layer on a cake plate.  Drizzle about 2 tablespoons Mint Syrup (recipe follows) over the bottom layer.  Spread on 1/2 cup of the whipped topping. Sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon crushed mints.  Add second layer and repeat the procedure.  Invert the top layer.  Sprinkle with rest of Mint Syrup.  Place right side up on top of second layer. Spread entire cake with remaining whipped topping and sprinkle with remaining crushed mints.  If desired, place scoops of vanilla ice cream on top.  Place in freezer until ready to serve.
Mint Syrup:
1/4  c. hard mint candies
1/4  c. water
