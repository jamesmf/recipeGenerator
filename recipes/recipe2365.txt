      Muffins:  In a small bowl, combine milk, oil, eggs and orange peel; mix well.  In a large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.  Pour egg mixture into flour mixture; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened.  Fold in strawberries*.  Fill muffin cups to rim with batter.  Sprinkle generously with streusel topping.  Bake 10 to 20 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool 5 minutes.  Remove muffins from pan; cool on wire rack.
      *Because frozen strawberries are not as firm as fresh, the batter will turn pink when frozen strawberries are added.  Serves 12.
