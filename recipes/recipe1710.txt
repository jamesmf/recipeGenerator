CHICKEN TERIYAKI


4  boneless chicken breasts, skinned
6  Tbsp. soy sauce (preferably shoyu; Japanese light soy sauce)
6  Tbsp. sake (Japanese rice wine) or dry sherry
2  Tbsp. sugar
2  garlic cloves, crushed
  1-inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and crushed
  salt and freshly ground pepper
1 to 2  Tbsp. vegetable oil

      Cut the chicken breasts into bite-size pieces.  Place the pieces in a shallow bowl.  Mix together half the soy sauce, sake and sugar, then add half the garlic and ginger with salt and pepper to taste.  Pour over the chicken.  Cover and leave to marinate overnight.  Turn the chicken pieces in the marinade occasionally during the marinating time.  Thread the cubes of chicken onto oiled kebab skewers.  Brush with oil.  Barbecue or broil under moderate heat for about 10 minutes, until the chicken is tender.  Baste the chicken with the marinade and turn frequently during cooking.
      While the chicken is cooking put the remaining soy sauce, sake and sugar in a small pan with the remaining garlic and ginger.  Add salt and pepper to taste and heat through.  Serve the chicken hot with the warmed soy sauce mixture poured over to moisten.  Serves four.
      Menu suggestion:  Spicy and sweet, this Japanese skewered chicken looks good on a bed of saffron rice.  For an exotic touch, follow with a mixed salad of oriental vegetables, such as bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, scallions and fresh ginger.
