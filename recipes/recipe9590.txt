CHEESE ROYALE


4  c. bread cubes (5 slices, crusts removed, buttered, then cubed)
1/2  lb. sharp Cheddar cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2  c. milk
3  eggs, beaten
  season to taste (salt and pepper)

      Place bread cubes in 6-cup casserole (13 x 9). Add cheese cubes and mix.  Beat eggs; add to milk. Add salt and pepper.  Pour over bread and cheese cubes.  Let stand at least 1 hour or overnight. Stick triangles of buttered bread slices around top to form a crown.
      Bake at 350 degrees; for 50 minutes or until, if pierced with a knife, knife comes out clean. Should be golden brown and nicely puffed up when removed from oven. Serves 6 to 8.
