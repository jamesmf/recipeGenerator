CHICKEN-VEGETABLE PACKETS


3  to 4 large potatoes, scrubbed well, unpeeled and cut into bite-size pieces
3  to 4 large carrots, diagonally sliced
1/2  lb. green beans, each snapped in half
3/4  c. water
3  Tbsp. butter or margarine
1 1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
1/4  tsp. thyme leaves
3  tsp. instant chicken flavor bouillon
4  chicken breasts (may use 1 thigh and 1 leg in place of 1 breast)

      Prepare outdoor grill.  In large bowl, mix all ingredients except chicken.  On double thickness of heavy-duty foil, place 1/4 of chicken and 1/4 of vegetable mixture.  Wrap chicken and vegetable mixture in foil.  Make certain seam of foil is folded several times to seal in juices.  Repeat to make three more packets.
      Place packets on grill over medium heat.  Cook approximately 45 minutes or until chicken and vegetables are fork-tender.  Turn packets occasionally with tongs.  Makes 4 servings.
