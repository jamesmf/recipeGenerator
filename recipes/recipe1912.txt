QUESADILLA CASSEROLE


1  lb. Cheddar cheese
1  lb. Monterey Jack cheese
1  doz. flour tortillas
1  medium onion, chopped fine
1 (28 oz.)  can tomatoes
1 (4 oz.)  can green chilies, seeded and chopped
1  Tbsp. jalapeno sauce
1  green bell pepper, sliced in rings

      Slice cheese about 1/4-inch thick by 4-inches long and 2-inches wide.  Preheat oven to 425 degrees;.  Oil 9 x 13-inch casserole or pan. Prepare quesadillas by stacking one of each kind of cheese near the edge of tortilla; top with rounded teaspoon each of onion and chilies.  Roll tortillas up around cheese, folding ends under to form 12 little packages.
      Place quesadillas in casserole, overlapping to fit.  Mash tomatoes in bowl with jalapeno sauce.  Pour over quesadillas and garnish with pepper rings.  Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until cheese is melted.  This makes a pretty dish, as well as a good one.
