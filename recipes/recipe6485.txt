SHRIMP CASSEROLE


5  c. cooked rice
1/2  stick oleo
1 1/2  bunches green onions
4  lb. peeled and deveined shrimp
2  cans Campbell's cream of shrimp soup
1  can Campbell's cream of potato soup
1  can Campbell's Cheddar cheese soup
4  oz. can chopped mushrooms
  salt and pepper to taste

      Saut√© chopped onions in oleo until limp, not brown; add peeled shrimp and cook 3 to 5 minutes until pink.  Add all other ingredients, soups, rice, salt and pepper.  I prefer to mix all before adding salt and pepper.  Sometimes you find you do not want more.  Pour in large casserole and bake 1/2 hour or until crusty. This makes about 10 servings.  Will make 3 medium casseroles.
