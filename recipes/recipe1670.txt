  Greek Feta cheese, crumbled (2 Tbsp. per serving)
2  slices tomato (per serving)
1  green onion (per serving)

Dressing:
1/3  part olive oil
1/3  part water
1/3  part vinegar

      In small bowl, combine all dressing ingredients and mix.  For four large salads, use 1/3 cup of everything.  Yield:  1 cup dressing.
      In individual bowls, place coarsely pulled-apart lettuce pieces.  Top with pineapple (do not drain too much, since the pineapple juice will add flavor to the salad) and the rest of the ingredients, in order:  pineapple, beets, cheese, tomato, onion, green pepper and olives.
