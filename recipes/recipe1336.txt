BREAD STICKS OR CRACKERS


1 1/4  c. whole-wheat flour
1/2  c. quick or rolled oats
1  tsp. honey
1/2  tsp. salt
2  Tbsp. coconut
1/4  c. sunflower seeds
3/4  c. water

      Blend oats until fine.  Remove from blender.  Blend remaining ingredients (except flour) until smooth.  Stir together all ingredients.  Roll dough between hands to form into sticks (use flour on hands to keep from sticking).  Bake at 350 degrees;.
      For crackers, spread thinly on a nonstick or slightly greased cookie sheet.  (Dampen hands with water to spread.)  Cut into squares.  Poke each square with a fork to keep from bubbling. Sprinkle lightly with salt and bake at 350 degrees; for approximately 20 minutes.
