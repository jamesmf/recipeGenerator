FRESH ORANGE CHICKEN


2  broiler-fryers (3 lb. each), cut into serving pieces
  salt and pepper
1/2  c. butter or margarine
1  c. chopped onion
2  Tbsp. grated orange peel
1  c. freshly squeezed orange juice
1/2  c. dry white wine or canned chicken consomm
2  Tbsp. sugar
2  Tbsp. freshly squeezed lemon juice
3  oranges, peeled and sliced into cartwheels

	Season chicken well with salt and pepper. Saut in butter over medium heat until golden brown on all sides. Add onions and saut until soft. Transfer to shallow baking pan. Cover with mixture of orange peel, orange juice and wine. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees; for 45 minutes or until tender, turning during baking. Place chicken on serving platter. Keep warm.
	 Strain pan drippings and reserve. In small saucepan, melt sugar over medium heat just until golden brown. Remove from heat; immediately stir in lemon juice, then drippings. Bring to a boil, stirring until caramel is melted. Briskly simmer 7 to 10 minutes until slightly syrupy. Add orange cartwheels and heat until warm. Pour over chicken and serve at once.
