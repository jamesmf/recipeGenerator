AU GRATIN POTATOES


4  medium potatoes, peeled and cut in 1/4-inch slices
2  Tbsp. oil
4  medium onions, sliced
2  tsp. garlic powder
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. black pepper

      Spray 2-quart shallow baking dish with cooking spray and set aside.  Cover potatoes with cold water in a pot and bring to a boil.  Cook until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain and set aside.  While potatoes are cooking, heat oil over medium heat in a large nonstick skillet.  Add onions and garlic; cook until onions are softened and beginning to brown (about 15 minutes). Spread thin layer of potatoes in baking dish, salt, pepper and onion mixture.  Repeat layers ending with onions.  Pour in milk. Sprinkle with parsley flakes on top.  Bake until potatoes are slightly brown.  Bake (preheated) at 400 degrees; for about 20 minutes.
