4  tbsp. flour (all purpose)
4  tbsp. butter
2  c. milk
1/4  c. Holland House Cooking Wine or your favorite white wine
2  tbsp. lemon juice

      White Sauce:  In medium saucepan melt 4 tbsp. butter; blend in the 4 tbsp. flour till it's absorbed into the butter; let bubble for 1 minute.  Remove from heat and stir in milk a little at a time till smooth.  Return to medium heat and cook, stirring constantly till thickened.
