ZUCCHINI PATTIES


3 1/2  c. (about 1 lb.) grated zucchini
3  Tbsp. grated onion
2  Tbsp. minced parsley
1/3  c. freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1  c. soft bread crumbs
3/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
2  eggs, well beaten
  fine bread crumbs
  melted butter

      After  grating the zucchini, squeeze out as much liquid as possible  with  hands.  Combine  zucchini, onion, parsley, cheese and  1 cup of bread crumbs with salt, pepper and eggs. Shape  into patties  and  cover  with bread crumbs.  Place on well-greased cookie sheet and brush with melted butter.  Bake in  a  350 degrees;  oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden brown. You  can  fry  these patties in a skillet with butter, if desired.
