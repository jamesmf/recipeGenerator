PICKLED EGGS


2  c. vinegar
1  qt. of pickled beet juice
1  qt. of pickle juice
2  c. sugar
2  c. water
  eggs, hard boiled

      Put any amount of eggs in a pot.  Cover with water and bring to a boil.  Let eggs boil for 15 minutes.  Take off of heat and cool under cold water.  Peel eggs while warm.  While eggs are boiling, go ahead and mix all other ingredients in a large pot on the stove. Heat mixture and taste.  For sweeter eggs use more sugar.  For sour eggs use more vinegar.  Put warm eggs into a warmed glass jar. Pour heated pickle mixture over eggs.  They'll pickle quicker when warm.  Let jar cool and place into refrigerator at least 4 to 5 days.  The longer the eggs stay in juice the more they will pickle.
