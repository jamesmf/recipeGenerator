BARBECUED PORK


5  lb. Boston butt
1  large onion, chopped
3  Tbsp. brown sugar
3  Tbsp. dry mustard
1/4  tsp. red pepper
1/4  tsp. black pepper
1  c. vinegar
1 1/2  c. water
1/2  c. ketchup
1/2  c. Worcestershire sauce
1  Tbsp. salt

	Put meat in a roaster or deep pan. Mix onion, sugar, mustard, peppers, vinegar, water, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and salt. Pour over meat. Cover and cook in 350 degrees; oven 5 to 6 hours or until meat is ready to fall off the bones. Remove from oven and allow meat to cool in juices in refrigerator. When cool, skim off all fat; remove meat from bones and chop into small pieces, then put it back into sauce. Warm what you need and refrigerate the rest.
