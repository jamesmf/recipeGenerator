1  Tbsp. red wine vinegar
1  tsp. finely chopped garlic

      Cut pork into 1-inch cubes.  Place in mixing bowl.  Add remaining ingredients and stir until well mixed.  Cover and marinate at least 15 minutes (the longer the better).  Heat grill. Put pork on skewers or a grill pan.  Cook 20 minutes or until done.
