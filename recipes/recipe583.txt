TURKEY SCALOPPINE WITH RASPBERRY VINEGAR


2  lb. turkey scaloppine
2 to 3  Tbsp. whole wheat flour, seasoned with salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste
2  Tbsp. olive oil
1/4  c. raspberry vinegar
1/2  c. chicken broth
1  Tbsp. tomato paste
  salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste

      Flatten the turkey breasts and lightly dust with the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess.  (A powdered sugar shaker makes an excellent flour shaker for dusting.)  In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil and saut√© the turkey over high heat, about 1 minute on each side, or until lightly browned.  Do not crowd the pan and do not overcook the turkey.  As the scaloppine is browned, remove to a warm platter.  Add the vinegar and then broth.  Bring to a boil and continue to stir until the sauce is smooth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour over the turkey and serve immediately, garnished with freshly chopped parsley.  Serves 6.
