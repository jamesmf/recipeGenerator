MUSHROOM QUESADILLAS


  vegetable oil spray
8  oz. fresh sliced mushrooms
1/2  medium onion, thinly sliced and separated into rings
1  tsp. minced garlic
3  Tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro
3  (8-inch) flour tortillas
6  Tbsp. shredded low-fat Monterey Jack cheese (with jalapeno peppers) or low-fat Cheddar cheese
  commercial salsa or Fresh and Chunky salsa

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;. Spray a large skillet with vegetable oil. Cook mushrooms, onion and garlic in skillet over medium heat until onion is tender, about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in cilantro and remove from heat. Arrange 1/3 of the mushroom mixture on half of 1 tortilla. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the cheese. Fold the other half of the tortilla over the cheese. Place on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 3 quesadillas total. Bake quesadillas about 5 minutes or until filling is hot and cheese melts. Cut each quesadilla into 4 wedges. Serve warm with salsa, if desired. Serves 6 (2 wedges per serving).
