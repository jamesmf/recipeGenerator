PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH POTATO SALAD


3  lbs potatoes (red, gold, etc - you can leave skins on)
1  tsp celery seed
1/2  lb bacon (fried crispy & crumbled to add to salad)
6  hard boiled eggs (diced small)

 
Dressing:
1  cup mayonnaise
1/4  cup vinegar
1/4  cup onions (finely chopped)

      Mix the dressing together and chill 2 hours, mix everything together and garnish with parsley and/or cherry tomatoes  split in half, peeled carrots, bell pepper rings or egg yolks finely chopped.  I like to let it chill for at least a day before eating it.
