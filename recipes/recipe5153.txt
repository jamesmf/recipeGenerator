HAWAIIAN SALAD


1  c. sugar
1 1/2 to 2  Tbsp. flour
2 1/2  tsp. salt (optional)
1 3/4  c. pineapple juice
2  eggs, beaten
2  Tbsp. lemon juice (optional)
3  qt. water
1  Tbsp. cooking oil
1 (16 oz.)  pkg. soup pasta
3 (11 oz.)  cans Mandarin oranges
2 (20 oz.)  cans pineapple chunks, drained
1 20  oz. can crushed pineapple
1  carton whipped topping

      Combine sugar, flour and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.  Gradually stir in pineapple juice and eggs.  Cook over moderate heat, stirring until thickened.  Add lemon juice.  Cool mixture to room temperature.  Bring water, remaining 2 teaspoons sat and oil to a boil.  Add pasta.  Cook at rolling boil until pasta is done. Drain pasta, rinse and cool.  Combine egg mixture and pasta.  Mix lightly but thoroughly.  Refrigerate overnight in airtight container.  Add remaining ingredients.
      Salad may be refrigerated for as long as a week in an airtight container.  It may also be frozen, although freezing may alter the texture.
      This makes a large salad, but it fits perfectly in the large yellow Tupperware bowl.
      Options:  You may also add 1 cup of miniature marshmallows and/or 1 cup of coconut.
