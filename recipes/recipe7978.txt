MEATBALLS


1  lb. hamburger
1/2  c. bread crumbs
1  Tbsp. minced onion
1  tsp. salt
1/8 to 1/2  tsp. allspice
1/8  tsp. pepper
  add a little milk (to handle)
  mushroom soup

      Mix together all ingredients, except soup, and make into meatballs.  Brown on baking sheet, turning over once.  Move meatballs to casserole and add mushroom soup.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 1/2 hour or a little longer.  These freeze very good, so you can double batch and have ready for next batch of company.
