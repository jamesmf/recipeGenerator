MARINATED ARTICHOKE AND PASTA SALAD


6  oz. rotelle or other pasta
6  small tomatoes
1 (14 oz.)  can artichoke hearts, drained
1/2  lb. fresh mushrooms
1 (7 oz.)  jar green olives, drained
1/4  c. salad oil
1/4  c. red or salad vinegar
1  clove garlic, minced or pressed
1  tsp. oregano
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper

      Cook pasta according to package directions; drain, rinse and set aside.  Cut tomatoes into quarters or eighths; place in large bowl.  Trim off any tough pieces on artichoke hearts; halve and place in bowl.  Add mushrooms and olives (halve or quarter, if needed); toss gently.
      In a shaker jar, combine remaining ingredients; shake well to mix.  Pour dressing over vegetables; toss.  Add cooked pasta to salad; toss gently, being careful not to break pasta.  Cover with plastic wrap.  Serve salad at room temperature; refrigerate leftovers.  Add shrimp, Italian sausage, pepperoni or salami to make a main dish salad.
