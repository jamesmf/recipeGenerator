APPLE PECAN PANCAKES

Pancakes:
1  c. all-purpose flour
2  Tbsp. brown sugar
2  tsp. baking powder
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. ground cinnamon
3/4  c. plus 2 Tbsp. milk
2  eggs, separated
1  tsp. vanilla extract
1/2  c. finely chopped peeled apple
1/2  c. finely chopped pecans

      In a bowl, combine flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon.  Stir in milk, egg yolks and vanilla.  Add apple and pecans.  Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form; fold into batter. Pour batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto a hot greased griddle.  Turn when bubbles begin to form and the edges are golden brown.  Cook until the second side is golden brown.  Makes about 12 pancakes.

2  Tbsp. cornstarch
1/4  tsp. ground allspice

1 3/4  c. apple juice or cider

      In a saucepan, combine brown sugar, cornstarch, allspice and nutmeg; mix well.  Add juice or cider.  Cook and stir over medium heat until syrup is bubbly and slightly thickened.  Pour over warm pancakes.
