GROUND BEEF CASSEROLE


1  lb. ground beef
2  cans tomato sauce
1  tsp. garlic juice
  5-6 oz. pkg. noodles, cooked
  Sour cream
1 (3 oz.)  pkg. cream cheese
3  green onions, chopped
  Grated cheddar cheese

      Brown ground beef and drain.  Add tomato sauce and garlic juice.  Simmer for about 25 minutes.  Cook a 5 or 6 oz. package of noodles as directed.  Make a white sauce of sour cream,  cream cheese and chopped green onions (can use white onions).  Put layers of noodles, ground beef, and sauce into a casserole dish. Sprinkle with grated cheddar cheese.  Bake for 25 minutes at 350 degrees;.
      This makes a huge casserole.  I usually divide this into two casserole dishes and freeze one.
