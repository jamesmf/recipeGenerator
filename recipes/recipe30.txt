CHOCOLATE FILLED COOKIES


1  c. margarine, softened
4 1/2  oz. pkg. instant chocolate pudding
1  egg
2  c. flour
3  Tbsp. sugar
  cherry filling

 
Icing:
1/2  c. semi-sweet chocolate chips
3  Tbsp. butter

      In large bowl, cream margarine.  Mix in instant pudding until light and fluffy.  Beat in egg.  Gradually add flour until dough forms.  Shape dough into 1-inch balls.  Roll the balls in sugar, then place them 2-inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
      With your thumb, make an imprint in the center of each ball. Bake at 325 degrees; for 15 to 18 minutes, or until firm.  Remove from cookie sheet at once.  Cool.  Fill each imprint with 1/2 teaspoon cherry filling.
      In small saucepan, make icing.  Blend chocolate chips and butter; stir over low heat, until chocolate melts.  Drizzle 1/2 teaspoon over each cookie.  Makes 48 cookies.
