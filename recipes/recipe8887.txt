      Cook lasagna noodles according to the directions. Set aside in a bowl of cold water. Tear wrapping off Italian sausage. Brown Italian sausage and ground beef together. Add onions, peppers and mushrooms and cook until tender. Reduce heat. Add tomato sauce, diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Stir well. Sprinkle garlic powder until it covers top of sauce. Do the same with onion powder and oregano. Lightly sprinkle basil or to suit your taste. Simmer on low 20 minutes. Set aside.
      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;. You will need 2 rectangle baking dishes or 1 large lasagna pan. Set up lasagna in the following order: Sauce, lasagna noodles, Ricotta cheese, Swiss cheese, Cheddar/Monterey Jack cheeses, Mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese. Repeat. Spread bottom of pan with thin layer of sauce. Add layer of lasagna and cheeses and repeat. You should have 2 layers. End with sauce, Mozzarella and Parmesan. Be sparing with the sauce or you won't have enough to finish off the lasagna. Cook at 350 degrees; for 20 to 30 minutes or until cheeses are melted. You might need to put a cookie sheet under your lasagna to catch any "spill-over." Serve with garlic bread and your favorite salad.
