LEMONADE


5  to 6 lemons
1  c. sugar
3  qt. water
1  qt. ice
  grating of nutmeg

      Squeeze 3 to 4 lemons, removing seeds.  Slice remaining lemons. Put in a 1-gallon container.  Add 1/2 cup of sugar.  Let stand at least 30 minutes.  This gives the sugar a chance to dissolve and the sugar will pull the juice from the lemon slices.  Add rest of sugar, water and ice.  Sprinkle with nutmeg.  Makes 1 gallon.
