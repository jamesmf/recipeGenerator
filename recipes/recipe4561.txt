POTATO SOUP SUPREME
(Makes 175 Twelve Ounce Bowls)  

70  lb. potatoes
2  (5 lb.) boneless hams
1  gal. milk
10 (2 oz.)  bottles dehydrated Spicetime Vegetable flakes
10  lb. carrots
8  large onions
2  whole stalks celery
5  lb. Velveeta cheese (processed cheese spread)
8  large crowns broccoli with stems
2 (3.75 oz.)  jars Wyler chicken granules
  flour
  Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning

 
You Will Need:
3  large (15 - 16 qt.) roasters
1 (24)  qt. pot

      Peel and cube potatoes. Slice ham in 1/2 inch slices; slice them into thick strips and cube. Cut cheese in small cubes or strips. Peel carrots; process in food processor until they are small pieces (not too fine). Wash broccoli; cut into 1 inch pieces (including stems); put in food processor and process very fine. Chop celery and onions into 1 inch pieces. Process in food processor until small, but not pulverized.
      Fill a large (15 - 16 qt.) Magnalite roaster about half full of water. Add both jars chicken granules, celery, onions, carrots, broccoli, and vegetable flakes. Cook until almost tender. Fill each of the 3 roasters and the 24 qt. pot half way with water and divide the vegetable mixture between the pots.
      Into these pots, divide the potatoes. Cook till they begin to get tender (some will fall apart). Divide cubed ham between pots; divide cheese between pots. Pots must be stirred to keep from sticking. When cheese is almost melted, divide the milk and add enough flour for thickening; divide between the pots and finish filling pots with water. (If soup is not thick enough, add more flour. Soup will thicken as it sets, so be careful not to add too much.)
      When mixture begins to get hot, reduce heat and continue to stir. Sprinkle a layer of Tony's seasoning on top (season to taste). Serve with a big cornbread muffin. M-mmm! Good for whatever ails you!
