CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS


2 to 3  lb. chicken, cooked and deboned, saving broth
1 1/2  stick butter
2 1/2  c. plain flour
  pinch of salt

      Remove 1/2 cup broth from chicken pot and let cool.  Return deboned chicken to the broth; add butter and 2 cups water.  Cook on medium heat until it comes to a boil.  Combine flour and 1/2 cup cooled broth to make dumplings.  Knead like making bread. Roll out thin and cut into strips.  Place a layer of strips on top of boiling chicken mixture.  Wait until mixture begins to boil again and then mash strips down into broth with a fork.  Place next layer of dumpling strips on top of chicken mixture and repeat process until all dough is used up.  DO NOT STIR AND DO NOT OVERCOOK.  Cook only until dumplings are done.
