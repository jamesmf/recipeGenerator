CRANBERRY SAUCE WITH PORT


1  pkg. (12-oz.) fresh cranberries (3 c.)
1  c. port wine
3/4  c. sugar
1/2  tsp. ground cinnamon
1/4  tsp. ground nutmeg
1/8  tsp. ground cloves

      In a 2-quart saucepan, heat cranberries, port, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to boiling over high heat, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to medium and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until most cranberries pop, about 10 minutes. (Mixture will thicken as it chills.)  Spoon sauce into serving bowl; cover and refrigerate until well-chilled, about 3 hours or up to 4 days.  Makes about 2 cups.
