JAMBALAYA


1  lb. chicken filets, cubes
1  lb. smoke sausage
1  tsp. cooking oil
1  Tbsp. Kitchen Bouquet
3  c. rice (makes 6 c. cooked rice)

	Put oil, chicken and sausage in a pan and saut. Once the chicken is white, add enough water to reach the top of your meat. Put to cook on a medium fire and cover for 40 minutes, add seasoning to taste and add water when needed. After 40 minutes, add Kitchen Bouquet and cook for another 5 minutes. Take fire off the meat once you cook it for 45 minutes. Put rice to cook separately; once the rice is done, add the rice to the meat and stir together and you are done.
