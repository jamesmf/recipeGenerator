CABBAGE ROLLS


2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
1  onion, finely chopped
3/4  c. uncooked rice
8  large cabbage leaves
1  lb. ground meat
2 small  cans tomato sauce
  tomato sauce

      Combine first 3 ingredients; add meat and rice and mix together. Steam cabbage leaves 3 minutes or until limp. Place a small amount of meat mixture on each leaf; fold in sides and roll ends over meat. Cabbage rolls may be held together with a toothpick. Place in a pot deep enough to add enough water and tomato sauce to cover cabbage rolls. Cook slowly for about 1 hour or until done.
