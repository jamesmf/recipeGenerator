CHARLOTTE'S "DRESSED" EGGS


1  doz. large eggs
1  medium onion chopped
3  Tbsp. of chopped sweet pickles or pickle relish
1  tsp. celery seed
  Salt/pepper/garlic to taste
3  Tbsp. mayo/salad dressing (I use a mixture of both for taste/consistency)
  1-2 tsp. mustard
  Paprika

      Boil eggs and then let cool before peeling.  Cut eggs in half; scoop out yolks.  Place whites on separate plate.  In medium mixing bowl mash yolks and add the above ingredients.
      Place this mixture in the egg whites and sprinkle with paprika.  Transfer to your "fancy" plate and chill for at least 8 hours.
