ITALIAN WEDDING SOUP


8  c. homemade chicken broth
3/4  lb. ground beef
3/4  lb. ground pork
3  eggs plus 5 eggs
1  c. dry bread crumbs
2  tsp. dried basil
1  tsp. dried parsley
1/2  c. grated Parmesan plus 1 c.
2  medium heads escarole, cleaned and chopped

      In a separate pot over medium heat, bring broth to a boil. In separate large bowl, combine the beef, pork, 3 eggs, bread crumbs, basil, parsley and 1/2 cup Parmesan.  Mix well and form into bite size balls.  Drop the balls into the broth.  Add escarole into broth.  When balls rise to the top, they are cooked, about 5 to 7 minutes.  When escarole is wilted, it is done.  In a separate bowl, combine the remaining 5 eggs with the remaining cheese.  Pour this mixture into soup, stirring continuously until the egg is cooked.
