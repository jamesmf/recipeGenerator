CRYSTALLIZED PEANUTS


2  c. shelled raw peanuts
1  c. sugar
1  c. water

      Put all ingredients together in heavy saucepan and boil over medium heat until all liquid is evaporated.  Some stirring will be required when liquid becomes low to prevent peanuts from scorching and to make sugar crystallize.  When all liquid is gone and peanuts have a good coat of sugar on them, pour upon a large platter or cookie sheet and stir through with spoon once or twice to break peanuts apart.
