SALMON PATTIES


1 (7 1/2 oz.)  can salmon, drained and flaked
1/2  c. crushed saltine crackers (about 12 crackers)
1  egg, slightly beaten
1/4  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. pepper
1/4  c. vegetable oil
  flour (to light coat patties)
1/4  c. ketchup, mixed with dash of Worcestershire sauce for dipping

	In bowl, mix together salmon, crackers, egg, salt and pepper, breaking up the salmon well.  Shape salmon mixture into 5 patties, using about 1/2 cup of mixture for each. Make sure they are firm.
	In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Cook patties until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes total.  Serve hot with ketchup/Worcestershire sauce mixture on the side.
