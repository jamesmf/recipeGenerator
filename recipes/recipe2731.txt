EASTER STRAWBERRIES


1  c. ground nuts
1  can Eagle Brand milk
1 (7 oz.)  pkg. shredded coconut
2 (3 oz.)  pkg. strawberry gelatin
1  box red tinted sugar
1  box green tinted sugar

      Mix gelatin, nuts and shredded coconut with the Eagle Brand milk.  Shape into strawberries.  Refrigerate until cold (much easier to handle).  Dip the top into green sugar.  Roll the berry in the red sugar.  If desired you can soak slivered almonds in green food coloring and use for stems.
