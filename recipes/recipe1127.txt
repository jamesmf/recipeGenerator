CHICKEN DELIGHT


2  lb. chicken breasts, boned and split
1  c. long grain rice
3  Tbsp. oil
1  green pepper, chopped fine
3  stalks celery, cut in 2-inch pieces
1  small onion, chopped fine
1  chicken bouillon cube
1/2  c. water chestnuts, drained and sliced thick
1  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. fresh ginger, chopped fine
3/4  c. water
1  tsp. arrowroot powder
1  tsp. soy sauce
1  lb. can bean sprouts, drained thoroughly

      Remove fat or gristle from chicken.  Split each piece into 2 thin layers, then cut layers into strips about 2-inches long, 1/4-inch wide.  Cook rice according to package directions (omit margarine).  Heat oil in skillet or wok, add chicken.  Stir constantly until chicken turns white and is slightly brown (approximately 2 minutes).  Turn heat to medium and add peppers, celery, onion, bouillon cube, water chestnuts, salt, ginger and water.  Make a smooth paste of arrowroot and soy sauce and stir in chicken mixture until smooth.  Cook gently 6 to 7 minutes, tightly covered.  Add bean sprouts to cooked vegetables; cover and cook gently another 2 minutes.  Each serving consists of 1/2 cup cooked rice with 1 cup chicken mixture.
