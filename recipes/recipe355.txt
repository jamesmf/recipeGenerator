CARAWAY CHICKEN


1 (10 oz.)  pkg. frozen spinach, cooked and drained
4  boned, skinless chicken breast halves (about 1 lb. total)
3/4  c. skim milk
2  tsp. cornstarch

1/4  tsp. caraway seed
1/8  tsp. pepper

      Divide spinach into four au gratin baking dishes (microwave-proof if using microwave).  In a large skillet sprayed with nonstick coating, put chicken and cook over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender or no longer pink, turning pieces occasionally.  Put chicken on top of spinach.  Pour sauce over chicken; cover with foil, seal, label and freeze.  Serves 4.
      Sauce:  Combine milk, cornstarch, bouillon, caraway seed and pepper and cook until thickened and bubbly (stir constantly).  Stir in cheese until melted.
