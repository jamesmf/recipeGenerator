CHICKEN AND SAUSAGE GUMBO


1  whole chicken, cooked and deboned (save broth)
1  lb. smoked sausage, cubed or sliced thin
1  c. diced celery
1  c. diced onion
1  c. diced bell pepper
4  cloves garlic, minced
2  bay leaves
1  can diced tomatoes
  chicken broth
1  tsp. salt
1  tsp. black pepper
1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper
1  tsp. thyme
1  tsp. oregano
1  Tbsp. paprika
2  c. chopped okra
1  bunch green onions, chopped
1/2  c. fresh chopped parsley
  Tabasco to taste

      A good gumbo starts with a roux, a cooked mixture of flour and grease (lard, shortening or oil).
      In iron skillet or heavy bottom Dutch oven, melt 1/2 cup lard or shortening. With wooden spoon or other wooden utensil, stir in 1/2 cup flour. Continue to cook over medium to medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until flour is caramel color or darker. (This process may take up to 30 minutes. Flour must be browned slowly to prevent burning. The darker the roux, the darker the gumbo will be. The roux is the thickening agent.)
      Add celery, onion and bell peppers; continue to stir until veggies begin to soften. Add garlic and sausage. Cook and stir for 5 more minutes. (At this point, you should be cooking in a 5-quart or larger pot.) Add bay leaves, tomatoes, chicken pieces and chicken broth to cover. Add spices. Bring to boil; lower heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Add okra. Add more chicken broth or water if necessary to cover. Continue to simmer, covered with lid, for 30 minutes. Remove lid; simmer on low, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Remove bay leaves. Add green onions and parsley. Serve in soup bowl over cooked white rice. Add a few drops of Tabasco to kick it up a notch.
      For shrimp gumbo, add 1 pound raw shrimp the last 15 minutes of cooking.
