LACE COOKIES


1  egg, beaten
1  Tbsp. flour
1  c. sugar
1/4  lb. or 1/2 c. melted butter
1  c. quick cooking oats
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. baking powder
1/2  tsp. vanilla

      Combine all ingredients.  Drop very small amount of dough (1/4 teaspoon, as it spreads thin) on greased and floured wax paper-lined cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees; for about 5 minutes until slightly brown at edges.  If underdone, will not come off paper. Allow cookies to cool on paper before removing.  Makes 80 to 100 cookies.  Cookies look like beige bits of lace.
