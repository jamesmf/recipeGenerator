FROZEN CABBAGE


1  medium head of cabbage, cut for coleslaw
1  Tbsp. salt
1  carrot, diced or shredded
1  red, green, or yellow pepper, chopped fine
1  small onion, diced if desired

      Chop up the cabbage and sprinkle with the salt.  Let stand for one hour.  Squeeze the juice our of the cabbage.  Add the carrot and pepper.
Dressing:
2  c. sugar
1  c. vinegar
1  tsp. celery seed
1  tsp. mustard seed

      Mix ingredients and boil for 1 minute.  Cool to lukewarm.  (I do this before cutting cabbage so it is cool by the time the cabbage is finished.)  Pour over cabbage and freeze.  Let set in the refrigerator 24 hours for the mixture to blend well.  Can be refrozen and keeps a long time in the refrigerator.
