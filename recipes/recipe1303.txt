SOY FLOUR TOFU


8  c. water (boiling)
2  c. soy flour
6  Tbsp. lemon juice

      Sift the flour and add it to the boiling water.  Simmer for 10 minutes.  (Stir frequently; do not let it boil over.)  Remove from heat and slowly add lemon juice (one tablespoon at a time).  The less you stir the bigger the curds will be.  Let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes.  Pour into a colander lined with cheesecloth or similar cloth to drain.  May run water through it, if desired.  Use as is for scrambled tofu or season as desired for salads, etc.  To form, squeeze out the remaining liquid and press into plastic container. Cover and refrigerate.
