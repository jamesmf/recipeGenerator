HONEY BARBECUE SAUCE


1  can (15 oz.) condensed tomato soup (or 1 can tomato sauce)
1/2  c. honey
2  Tbsp. worcestershire sauce
2 to 3  Tbsp. salad oil
1  Tbsp. lemon juice
1  tsp. mustard

      Combine all ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered 5 minutes.  Makes about 2 cups.
      Note:  A dash of cayenne pepper or bottled hot sauce can be added, as desired.  This sauce is good as a dipping sauce for KFC or chicken pieces.
