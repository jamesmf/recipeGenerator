HOMEMADE VEGETABLE SOUP


1  lb. stew beef (cover with water and cook 1 hour)
2  cans blended tomatoes
2  cans lima beans
1  can yellow corn
1  can cream-style yellow corn
1  can Campbell's tomato soup
3  diced potatoes
1  diced onion

      Cook stew beef 1 hour.  Add remaining ingredients with the exception of cream-style yellow corn. Cook 1 additional hour.  Add cream-style yellow corn and cook extra 15 minutes.  Stir almost constantly to keep cream-style corn from settling to the bottom and scorching.
