WEIHNACHTSKUCHEN
(Austria Christmas Cake)  

1  lb. shelled pecans (whole)
1  lb. dates (whole)
1/2  lb. candied cherries
1/2  lb. candied pineapple, cut in 1-inch pieces
4  eggs, beaten until fluffy
1  c. sugar
1  c. flour
1  tsp. vanilla

      Mix and sift dry ingredients over fruits and nuts.  Pour beaten eggs over mixture; add vanilla and mix well.  Pour into loaf pans, lined with wax paper, and bake in a slow oven at 275 degrees; for 1 1/2 hours.  Let stand 2 or 3 hours before removing from pans.
