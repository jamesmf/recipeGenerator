"FINTASTIC" NACHOS


1  lb. fish fillets (fresh or frozen)
  about 1/2 c. total vegetable oil
1  pkg. taco seasoning mix
1/4  c. water
1  box nacho chips
8  oz. sharp Cheddar cheese, grated
1  jar pitted black olives (optional)
1 medium  jar taco sauce

      Rinse fish (if fresh); remove any bones and mince.  Place enough vegetable oil to cover bottom of skillet or electric frying pan.  Add fish and cook until opaque.  Add extra oil if fish sticks to pan.  Add taco seasoning mix and about 1/4 cup water.  Mix well and warm for 1 minute.  Set aside.
      Line large cookie sheet with nacho chips.  Place 1 teaspoon fish and seasoning mix on top of each chip.  Sprinkle with grated Cheddar cheese and black olives; top with 1 teaspoon of taco sauce. Broil until cheese melts.  Serve immediately.
      Note:  Any species of fish will work in this recipe.  Try an inexpensive and under-utilized species.
