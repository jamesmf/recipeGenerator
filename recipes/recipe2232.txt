OLD FASHIONED APPLE BUTTER
(Michigan Style)  

3  lb. sliced cooking apples
1  qt. apple cider or apple juice
1 1/2  c. sugar
1  tsp. cinnamon
1/4  tsp. cloves

      Place apples and apple cider in a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven.  Over medium heat, bring apples to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 30 minutes or until apples are tender.  Drain apples, reserving liquid.  Press apples through a sieve, discarding peels.  Return apples to original pan with reserved liquid.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until apple mixture mounds on spoon, about 15 minutes.  Add sugar and spices.  Reduce heat to low and cook 1 hour longer, stirring frequently.  Mixture should thicken.  Quickly ladle hot mixture into sterilized jars and cover with lids and bands.  Process covered with boiling water for 5 minutes.  Yield:  3 1/2 cups.  Great on toast and biscuits.  This recipe contains no fat and it's only 40 calories per tablespoon.
