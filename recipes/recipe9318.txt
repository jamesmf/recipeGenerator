FOOLPROOF SLOW ROAST TURKEY


1  turkey (any size)
1/4  c. (1/2 stick) butter
2  c. water (approx.)

      Defrost and clean turkey.  Tie wings and legs to sides of turkey using 100% cotton string (this helps the turkey to cook more evenly and also holds the turkey together since it becomes very tender).
      Place turkey, breast up, on roasting pan (a roasting pan is a two-part pan; the bottom of the pan holds the drippings).  Rub butter over the surface of the turkey.  Put water in bottom of pan (this helps prevent drippings from drying in the pan so that drippings can be used for gravy).
      Bake at 350 degrees; for 1 hour.  Lower heat to 190 degrees; for 23 more hours.
      NOTE:  Cooking one hour at high heat kills surface bacteria. The length of cooking time is not critical.  Can cook for several hours more since the temperature is low and the turkey will not dry out.
      NOTE:  DO NOT put stuffing inside the turkey.  Cook on stove instead.  The inside needs to be left open so that the one hour of high heat will reach this surface.  Also, putting stuffing in the turkey tends to dry out the meat.
