PORK SCHNITZEL WITH MUSHROOM SAUCE


6  thin boneless "breakfast" pork chops
1/2  c. flour, seasoned with salt and pepper
2  eggs, beaten
1 1/2  c. seasoned dry bread crumbs
1  tsp. dried rubbed sage
2  Tbsp. vegetable oil
12  oz. sliced mushrooms
1  tsp. minced garlic
1 -12  oz. jar roasted chicken gravy
  juice of 1/2 a lemon

      Flatten each pork chop lightly with a flat meat mallet to a uniform thickness.  Place flour on a plate.  Place the eggs in a shallow dish.  Place seasoned bread crumbs in another shallow pan. Coating both sides each time, dip a pork chop in the flour first (shake off excess), then the eggs (coat well), then the bread crumbs.  Place on another plate until all 6 chops are breaded. Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a large non-stick skillet on medium-high heat.  When oil is hot, add 3 of the pork chops without letting the sides touch.  Cook to golden brown, about 2 minutes, and turn over for another 2 minutes.  Place cooked chops on a towel-lined plate and repeat for the remaining 3 chops, adding another tablespoon of oil to the pan first.
      When chops have finished cooking, sauté the mushrooms in the same pan, using the same oil and adding the garlic.  Season with salt and pepper and sauté over medium heat until the mushrooms are golden, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the chicken gravy and lemon juice and bring to a boil.  Place pork chops on a serving platter and top with the sauce.
