QUICK BEEF CASSEROLE


2 1/2  c. wide noodles
1  lb. lean ground beef
  garlic to your taste
  pepper to your taste
1  c. shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided
1  can tomato soup
1/2  can peas and carrots
1/2  can corn
1/3  can water
1/2  c. French fried onions (regular or cheese)

	Cook the noodles in boiling water for 10 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent noodles from sticking together. Brown the ground beef. Season meat with garlic and pepper. Add 1/2 cup of the cheese. Add the tomato soup, peas, carrots, corn and water.
	Place the beef mixture in a casserole dish and fold in the noodles. Sprinkle the noodle mixture with the remaining cheese and the French fried onions on top. Bake at 350 degrees; for 15 to 20 minutes or until bubbling.
