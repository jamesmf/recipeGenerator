2  pork tenderloins
1  Tbsp. olive oil, divided
1  Tbsp. chopped fresh rosemary leaves
1/2  tsp. salt, divided
1/2  tsp. freshly ground black pepper, divided
4  shallots, minced
1  garlic clove, minced
1  c. merlot or other dry red wine
1  Tbsp. chicken stock concentrate
2  Tbsp. cherry or blackberry preserves

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat pork with 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil, rub with rosemary, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Heat a heavy, ovenproof skillet over high heat.  Cook pork, turning often, until lightly browned on all sides, 5 minutes.  Transfer skillet and pork to oven; roast until instant-read thermometer reads 140 degrees, about 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a platter; keep warm.  Add remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil to same skillet.  Heat over medium heat.  Add shallots and garlic; cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes.  Add wine, cook over high heat until reduced by half, about 5 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium.  Stir in stock concentrate and preserves.  Add remaining 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper; adjust seasoning if necessary.  Whisk in butter.  Pour into a serving bowl.  Slice pork into 1/4 inch slices.  Makes 4 servings with sauce.
