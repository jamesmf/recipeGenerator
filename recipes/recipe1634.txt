CUCUMBER SALAD
(Agurkesalat)  

1  to 2 cucumbers
3  tsp. salt
2  Tbsp. vinegar
2  Tbsp. water
1  Tbsp. sugar
  pinch of pepper

      Wash and slice the cucumber finely.  Sprinkle with salt.  Place in a marinade previously prepared by boiling the vinegar, water, sugar and pepper together and allowing to cool.  Leave in a cold place for about two hours before serving.
      If, instead of vinegar, lemon juice is preferred, do not boil the marinade but stir in the sugar until dissolved.
