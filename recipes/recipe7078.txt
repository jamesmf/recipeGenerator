GARLIC RANCH CHICKEN


3  c. Hidden Valley Ranch dressing
2  Tbsp. garlic, chopped
1  Tbsp. fresh basil, chopped
4  chicken breasts (skinless and boneless)

      Combine dressing, garlic and basil in a heavy-duty zip-top plastic bag. Add chicken, turning to coat. Squeeze out air and seal bag. Place in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 30 minutes; the longer, the better. Grill chicken breasts on medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes on each side.
