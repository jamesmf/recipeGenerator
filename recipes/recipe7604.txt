ROAST BEEF ROLL UPS


  One pkg. (8-10 qty.) of 10-inch flour tortillas
  Ten large slices of deli roast beef, thin, but not "see through"
  One large head of green leaf lettuce (Does not work well with iceberg or romaine)
  One jar of horseradish sauce or mayonnaise

      Determine how many sandwiches you will need, and buy beef and tortillas accordingly.  These are made with the 10-inch fajita tortilla and can be cut in half if you want.  Spread each of the tortillas liberally with the horseradish sauce.  If you have folks that don't care for horseradish, I have used plain mayonnaise.  It just doesn't have the same zip!  Place one slice of roast beef in the center of the tortilla and top with a large leaf of lettuce. Roll up and place face down in a 9 x 13 pan to keep from unrolling.  Repeat with the remainder of tortillas and beef. Cover with Saran Wrap and refrigerate.  These are actually better if you can make them a day ahead.  Slice in half if you want before serving.
