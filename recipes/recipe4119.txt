APPETIZER MEATBALLS


1  lb. ground beef
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. black pepper
1/4 to 1/2  c. chopped water chestnuts
1/4  c. cold water
2  Tbsp. flour
4  Tbsp. oil

      Combine beef, salt, pepper, water chestnuts and water.  Mix thoroughly.  Form into small balls.  Roll lightly in flour.  Heat oil.  Brown meatballs; drain.  Makes 27 to 30 meatballs.
      These can be frozen at this point and thawed with the sauce used when ready to serve.  These are excellent with either the Sweet And Sour or the Grape Sauce.  Recipes follow.
Sweet And Sour Sauce:
2  Tbsp. cornstarch
1/2  c. sugar
1/2  c. vinegar
1  Tbsp. soy sauce
1  green pepper, chopped
1  red pepper, chopped
1 (10 to 13 oz.)  can pineapple chunks, undrained

      Combine all ingredients.  Heat.  Pour mixture over meatballs. Allow to simmer on very low heat, so that meatballs absorb the flavor of the sauce.  Serve hot in chafing dish or electric skillet.
Grape Sauce:
1  c. chili sauce
1  c. grape jelly
1  Tbsp. dark brown sugar

      Combine all ingredients.  Heat.  Add meatballs and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to coat meatballs.  Serve warm in chafing dish or electric skillet.
      If you want a milder sauce, substitute 1 cup catsup for the chili sauce.
