COLUMBUS COOKIES


6  oz. butter
8  oz. caster sugar
12  oz. plain or self-rising flour
1  egg, well beaten
2  Tbsp. strong black coffee
1  Tbsp. rum
2  tsp. baking powder (if using plain flour)
1/2  tsp. salt
3  oz. blanched nuts (cashews, almonds or peanuts), chopped

      Cream the butter and sugar.  Add 3 tablespoons flour to the egg, then beat in the coffee and rum.  Add this to the butter and sugar mixture and continue beating until it is a soft batter.  Sift the remaining flour with the baking powder, if used, and salt and add very slowly to the batter.  Stir in the chopped nuts, adding a little extra flour if the dough is not stiff enough to roll out. Refrigerate for 1 hour, then flour a board and roll out to 1/4-inch thickness and cut into desired shapes.  Bake on an ungreased baking sheet in a moderately hot oven (375 degrees;) for 10 to 15 minutes until cookies are firm and pale beige.
