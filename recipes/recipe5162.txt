STEAK AND PARMESAN SALAD


1  boneless beef sirloin steak, 1/2 inch thick, (1 lb.)
1  c. Italian salad dressing divided (prepared with less oil)
1  (10 oz.) bag mixed salad greens
1  medium tomato cut into wedges
1  medium yellow summer squash or zucchini, chopped
1/4  c. grated Parmesan cheese

      Place steak and 1/2 cup of the dressing in sealable plastic bag and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  Remove steak from marinade; discard marinade.  Grill or broil steak 5 to 10 minutes on each side or until cooked through.  Cut steak across the grain into slices.  Toss greens with tomatoes, squash and remaining 1/2 cup of dressing.  Place on serving platter.  Top with steak slices, sprinkle with cheese.
      Variation:  Prepare as directed, substituting 4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (1 pound) for the sirloin steak.
