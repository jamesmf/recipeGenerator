4  medium onions, grated

      Mix together cabbage, onions, pepper and pimentos. Make a syrup from vinegar, mustard seed, turmeric, sugar, celery seed and salt. Stir and simmer syrup for 6 minutes. Cool and then pour over slaw mixture. Let set at least 24 hours before using. The longer it sets, the better it is. Will keep as long as 5 or 6 months. Store in glass jar or similar container.
