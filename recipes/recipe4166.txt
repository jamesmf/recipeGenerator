SPINACH BALLS


2  boxes frozen, chopped spinach, cooked and drained
1  pkg. herb stuffing
1  onion, finely minced
5  eggs
3/4  c. melted butter
1/2  c. Parmesan cheese, grated
1/2  tsp. thyme

      Combine all ingredients.  Roll into balls.  Bake 15 minutes until brown.  Serve warm. Makes about sixty 1-inch balls.  Freezes well.
      I keep them warm in a crock-pot for the duration of a party.
