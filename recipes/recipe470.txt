CREPES


1  c. flour
1/2  tsp. salt
1  c. milk
2  eggs
  butter or margarine

      Put the flour and salt in a bowl; stir in the milk, drop in the eggs and beat the mixture with an eggbeater or a whisk until it's smooth.  It should be the consistency of a runny milkshake.  Put the batter in a pitcher so you can pour it into the pan.  You cook the crepes one at a time in a small frying pan.  Grease the pan with a tiny dab of butter or margarine.
