SPAGHETTI SAUCE
(Plan Ahead: Uses Slow Cooker)  

1  lb. ground beef
1  medium onion
2 (14 1/2 oz.)  cans diced tomatoes (undrained)
1 (8 oz.)  can tomato sauce
1 (6 oz.)  can tomato paste
1  Tbsp. brown sugar
2  tsp. ready to use minced garlic
1  tsp. dried basil
1  tsp. dried oregano
1  tsp. salt
1  tsp. dried thyme
  hot cooked spaghetti

      In a skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is done. Transfer to a slow cooker. Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, brown sugar, garlic, basil, oregano, salt and thyme. Cover and cook on low 7 to 8 hours or until heated through. Serve over spaghetti.
      This can be cooked on low on the stove top as well. Simmer on low for at least 2 hours.
