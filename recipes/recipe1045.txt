BEEF AND VEGETABLE SOUP


1 1/2  lb. boneless beef chuck, cut in 1/2-inch cubes
2  Tbsp. flour
1  tsp. salt
1  tsp. paprika
2  Tbsp. corn oil
1 1/2  qt. beef stock or water
1 1/2  qt. canned tomatoes, chopped
1/2  c. original Worcestershire sauce
1/3  c. chopped onion
1/2  tsp. minced garlic
1/2  c. sliced carrots
1/2  c. chopped celery
1/2  c. diced, peeled potatoes

      Dredge meat with flour that has been mixed with salt and paprika; shake off excess.  Heat oil in large saucepan until hot. Brown meat in hot oil on all sides.  Drain off excess fat.  Add beef stock, tomatoes, Worcestershire, onion and garlic.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until meat is almost tender, about 1 1/2 hours.  Add carrots, celery and potatoes; mix gently.  Simmer, covered, until vegetables are tender, 20 minutes.
