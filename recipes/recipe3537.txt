SOFT PRETZELS


1  pkg. active dry yeast (2 1/4 tsp.)
1  bottle of your favorite beer
1  Tbsp. sugar
1 1/2  tsp. salt
4  c. flour
1  egg, slightly beaten
  coarsely ground Kosher or sea salt

      Preheat oven to 425 degrees;.  Combine yeast, beer and sugar in mixing bowl.  Allow to stand until yeast is dissolved and begins to foam (about 5 minutes).  Stir in salt and flour.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead 5 minutes or until dough is smooth and elastic.  Separate dough into 12 equal pieces.  Roll each piece into 20 inch long rope and form pretzel shape.  Place on lightly greased baking sheet.  Brush with egg and sprinkle with kosher salt.  Bake 15 minutes until golden brown.  Remove and cool.
