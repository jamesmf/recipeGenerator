      In large skillet, brown steak well in oil, drain and set aside. In a soup pot, melt butter and add flour, stirring constantly. Very slowly add water, one cup at a time, to prevent mixture from becoming lumpy.  Add carrots, celery and onion.  Add mixed frozen vegetables and tomatoes.  Add Accent, Kitchen Bouquet, beef stock base, salt and pepper to taste.  Add browned meat, cover and simmer on low for 3 to 4 hours, stirring occasionally.  Uncover after 2 hours of cooking to thicken.  Serve hot with corn bread and green salad.  A thick hearty soup for Texas men's appetites, served on a cold winter day!
