CHOCOLATE DESSERT CREPES


1  c. all-purpose flour
1 1/2  c. milk
1/3  c. pre-sweetened instant cocoa powder
2  eggs
1  Tbsp. cooking oil
1  tsp. vanilla

      Combine all ingredients; beat with rotary beater until blended. Heat a greased 6-inch skillet; remove from heat.  Add 2 tablespoons batter; lift and tilt skillet to spread batter.  Return to heat, browning on one side (or cook with inverted crepe pan).  Invert over paper towel.  Remove crepe.  Repeat to make 16 to 18, greasing skillet each time.
