CROCK-POT STEAK AND GRAVY


4  lb. round steak
1/8  tsp. black pepper
1/8  tsp. garlic powder
3/4  c. water
10  Tbsp. flour
1  onion, chopped
2 (10.75 oz.)  cans condensed cream of mushroom soup
2  pkg. dry onion soup mix

      Cut steak into single serving pieces. Sprinkle with garlic powder and pepper. In crock-pot, layer half the steak, onion, 1 can of soup and 1 package of soup mix. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Add water. Cook on low heat 6 to 8 hours.
       When done, remove meat and keep warm. Measure remaining liquid from crock-pot and add 2 tablespoons of flour for each cup of liquid (approximately 5 cups of liquid). Cook, stirring until smooth and thick, about 4 minutes. Return meat to gravy and serve hot.
