MIRACLE LASAGNE


1 (28 oz.)  jar traditional Prego sauce
1  lb. ground beef (optional)
6  dry lasagne noodles
1  (15 oz.) container Ricotta cheese
2  c. shredded Mozzarella cheese
1/4  c. grated Parmesan cheese

      Spray 11 x 7-inch dish with cooking spray.  If using ground beef, brown, drain and mix with sauce.  In baking dish spread 1 cup sauce (if using ground beef use a little more sauce mixture).  Top with 3 dry noodles, half of the Ricotta cheese, half of the Mozzarella and half of the Parmesan.  Top that with 1 cup sauce. Repeat with noodles and cheese.  Top with remaining sauce.  Slowly pour 1/4 cup (or less) water around inside edge of dish.  Cover and bake at 375 degrees; for 1 hour.  Let stand 5 minutes and serve.
      I softened the Ricotta cheese in the microwave for 30 - 40 seconds, so it spreads easier on the noodles.
