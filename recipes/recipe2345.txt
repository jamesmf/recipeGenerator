STUFFED MUSHROOMS


2  lb. fresh mushrooms (larger are best)
1  c. finely crushed saltine crackers
1 1/2  tsp. salt (can be omitted)
1/8  tsp. pepper
1  Tbsp. chopped parsley
3  green onions, minced
1/4  c. butter, melted
1/4  c. butter, cut in pieces
1/2  c. heavy cream

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Clean mushrooms; remove caps and chop stems.  Mix cracker crumbs with spices, onions and melted butter. Add chopped mushroom stems.
      Line a buttered 9-inch pie pan with whole mushroom caps.  Cover with crumb mixture and dot with remaining butter.  Pour cream over all.  Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes.
      Note:  Makes a great hors d'oeuvre by omitting the cream and baking for only 20 minutes.
