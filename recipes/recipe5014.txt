PEA & CORN SALAD


1/2  green pepper, chopped
  2-3 ribs celery, chopped
1  small onion, chopped
1 large  can green peas, drained
1 large  can green beans, drained
1 large  can shoe peg corn, drained
1 large  can yellow corn, drained
1 small  jar chopped pimento, drained
  Salt, pepper and paprika to taste
1/2  c. Italian dressing, fat free
1/2  c. cider vinegar
1/2  c. sugar
1/4  c. water

      Mix all the vegetables together in a very large bowl.  You'll need stirring room.  Mix dressing, vinegar, sugar and water together.  Pour over vegetables and stir well.  Refrigerate and serve the next day.  Best made a day ahead so all the flavors mingle.
      This recipe can be doubled for a party, and goes over really well.
