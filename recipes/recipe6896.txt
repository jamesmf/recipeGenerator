	Saute onions in butter until clear. Add parsley, onion tops and bell peppers. Cook until tender (about 2 to 3 minutes). Remove from heat and let cool. Add beaten egg and water. Stir thoroughly and add shrimp and crabmeat and toss gently. Add bread crumbs to make dressing consistency. Spread stuffing on half of each filet and fold over, fastening with toothpicks. Sprinkle paprika over each piece and place in greased baking pan. Bake in preheated 375 degrees; oven, basting with margarine, lemon juice and parsley flakes often. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. You can also cover with bread crumbs to make crispier.
