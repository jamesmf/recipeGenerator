FAMILY REUNION BAKED BEANS


2 1/2  c. dry navy beans
1  large onion, chopped
1/2  c. catsup
1/2  c. brown sugar, packed
1/2  c. dark corn syrup
1 1/2  tsp. paprika
1/2  tsp. dried basil
1  tsp. dried mustard
2  Tbsp. molasses
1 1/2  lb. cooked smoked ham, diced
1/2  lb. bacon

      Soak beans overnight in twice their volume of water.  Rinse beans and cook in Dutch oven until just soft (about 30 minutes). If your water is hard, add 2 Tbsp. soda during cooking.  Put all other ingredients in crockpot, stir and cook on low setting for 30 minutes.  Add cooked beans and cook at low temperature until beans are dark brown, 6 to 8 hours.
