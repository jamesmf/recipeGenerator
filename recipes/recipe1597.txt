(Cheese Pie)  
Crust:
28  oz. flour
1  oz. cake yeast
2 pinches salt, in 5  Tbsp. sugar
14  oz. softened butter
4  eggs
1 1/4  c. milk (at room temperature) plus 1 Tbsp. sugar

      Put the flour in a bowl.  Put the yeast in the milk with the sugar in another bowl.  When the yeast is dissolved, add the milk to the flour while mixing with the mixer.  Add the egg yolks and mix.  Add the sugar and butter and mix until the mixture becomes "solid."  Place the bowl in a warm place; cover with a towel and allow to rise for 1 to 2 hours.  After the dough has risen, cut into fourths.  Roll out to the size of a pie pan.  Place in a greased pie pan and mold to the pan.  Prick the crusts with the tines of a fork.
      Do 2 crusts at a time.  Let them stand for 10 minutes while preparing the cheese.
Cheese:
2.2  lb. cream cheese
8  eggs, separated
3 1/2  oz. whipped cream
7  oz. sugar
7  oz. softened butter
15  drops almond extract

      Preheat the oven to 450 degrees;.  Whip the egg whites to stiff peaks. Place the cheese in a bowl.  Mix with mixer until fluffy.  Add the sugar, egg yolks, almond extract, whipped cream and butter.  Mix. Slowly fold in the egg whites.  Put a layer of stewed apricots or apricot jam 1/16-inch thick on each crust.  Place 1/4 of the cheese on top of the apricots.  Place each pie on a separate rack in the oven or on top of the other.  Bake for 20 minutes, then switch the pie from the top shelf to the bottom and the bottom to the top and bake for another 15 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool before serving.
