SOFT CHICKEN TACOS


1  can Swanson's white chicken
4  oz. salsa (I use picante)
  corn tortillas
  shredded lettuce
  chopped tomato
  fat-free sour cream (optional)

      In frying pan, add drained canned chicken. Heat through for 5 to 6 minutes (do not let it dry out). Add salsa (you may need more or less than 4 ounces) and heat an additional 5 minutes. Heat corn tortillas on a griddle or in a pan. Add chicken mixture to tortillas and shredded lettuce and tomato and anything else that sounds good. Makes 4 servings.
