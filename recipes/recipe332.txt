ROMAINE-VEGETABLE SALAD



1/2  small head romaine lettuce
2  stalks celery, thinly sliced
1 (16 oz.)  pkg. loose-pack frozen broccoli, red peppers, bamboo shoots and straw mushrooms
2  Tbsp. water
1  Tbsp. white wine vinegar
1  Tbsp. cooking oil
2  tsp. soy sauce
1/4  tsp. five-spice powder

      Dressing:  Mix vinegar, oil, soy sauce and five-spice powder in a custard cup or small bowl; set aside.
      Clean and tear romaine into bite-size pieces (makes about 3 cups).  In a 12-inch skillet combine frozen vegetables and water. Cook over medium-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes or until thawed and just heated through, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to medium. Stir in dressing and add romaine and celery.  Carefully toss about 30 seconds or until romaine begins to wilt.  Makes 6 servings.
      To Serve:  Immediately spoon romaine mixture onto salad plates.
