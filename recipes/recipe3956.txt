BARBECUED MUSHROOMS


1  lb. mushrooms
2 or 3  cloves garlic, minced, (I get little jar of minced garlic at Krogers)
2 or 3  Tbsp. oil
3  Tbsp. catsup
  Salt, pepper and onion powder to taste

      Clean the mushrooms and cut in slices. Microwave on high for 4 minutes in a covered dish. Stir halfway through, drain liquid. Saut garlic in oil. Add mushrooms, salt, pepper, and onion powder. Mix and add catsup. Continue saut until catsup is absorbed and sticks to bottom of pan. (More catsup can be added if necessary.)
