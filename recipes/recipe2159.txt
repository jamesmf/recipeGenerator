ORANGE FONDANT


2  c. sugar
2  Tbsp. white Karo syrup
3  Tbsp. orange juice
1  c. water
  grated rind of 1 orange
1  tsp. lemon juice

      Microwave candy on Roast - a setting that allows sugar syrup to quickly boil and blend into a candy, yet needs little watching. Mix and cook ingredients in a buttered glass mixing bowl or 4-cup glass measure.  Bowl or dish must be 2 or 3 times as large as the volume of the candy ingredients so candy syrup will not boil over. Cover candy during cooking when called for in the recipe.  Use a glass plate or stretch plastic wrap tautly across the bowl or glass measure; pierce plastic wrap so steam escapes during cooking. There is no need to worry that candy will scorch because microwaves cook from all sides, not just the bottom.  Candy syrups are usually stirred once during cooking so heat is equalized and candy cooks smooth.  Do watch candy closely because a microwave oven cooks fast.  When candy is removed from oven, it should register 236 degrees; on a candy thermometer.  Do not put a candy thermometer into a microwave oven or it will be damaged.
