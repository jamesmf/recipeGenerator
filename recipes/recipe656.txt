PASTA AND CAULIFLOWER SOUP


1  small cauliflower head
1/2  c. olive oil
1  garlic clove
  salt to taste
  pepper to taste
1  Tbsp. tomato paste
2 1/2  qt. hot water
1  potato, sliced paper thin
2  tsp. salt
1/2  lb. linguine or spaghetti, broken into bits
3 to 4  Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese

      Break the cauliflower into its flowerets, cutting the bigger ones in halves or quarters so that all the pieces are about 1/2-inch in size.  Put the oil in a soup pot along with the garlic, salt, pepper and the cut-up cauliflower.  Stirring gently, cook over medium heat until the vegetable bits are well oiled and flavored.  Add the tomato paste, hot water, the potato slices and 2 teaspoons salt and bring to a boil.  Break the pasta into 1 or 2-inch lengths as you put it in the pot.  Continue boiling until the pasta is well cooked, has absorbed some of the water and the cauliflower, garlic and tomato have lent their flavors to the pasta.  Before serving discard the garlic clove.  Serve with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.
