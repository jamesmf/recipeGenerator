CHUNKY CHICKEN CASSEROLE


1 (6 oz.)  pkg. Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice
1  can cream of celery soup
1 small  jar pimentos
1/2  c. mayonnaise
1/4  c. chopped onion
2  c. chopped cooked chicken
1  can sliced water chestnuts, drained
1  pkg. slivered/sliced almonds (optional)
  Cheddar cheese

      Prepare rice as directed on package, using chicken broth instead of water. Add 1/2 cup more liquid than called for and omit butter. (I use broth from boiling the chicken breasts or whole chicken, whichever you use.) To cooked rice mixture, add the remaining ingredients with the exception of the cheese. Pour mixture into casserole. Top with grated cheese to cover mixture. Bake at 350 degrees; for 30 minutes. Serves 8.
