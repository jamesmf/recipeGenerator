GRILLED SWORDFISH WITH SPINACH PESTO



4  swordfish steaks (about 2 lb.), cut 1-inch thick

 
Spinach Pesto:
1  c. firmly packed young and tender spinach, washed and dried with stems removed
2  Tbsp. olive oil
2  Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese
1  Tbsp. pine nuts
1  clove garlic, finely minced
  salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
  lemon wedges and lemon juice

      Preheat an outdoor grill or broiler.  Place the fish in a shallow dish.  In a food processor or blender, combine the spinach pesto ingredients and process until smooth.  Slather on both sides of the fish.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.  Grill or broil the fish for 6 to 8 minutes per side, or until just flaky, basting occasionally.  Do not overcook or the fish will dry out.  Place the fish on a platter.  Serves 4.
