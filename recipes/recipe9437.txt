CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS


2  c. flour (self-rising)
1  egg, beaten
1  c. chicken broth
1  whole stewing chicken

	Mix and make dough. Roll out very very thin or dumplings will be tough. Cut in strips 1-inch wide. Lay on cookie sheet lined with wax paper. Freeze.
	The next day, cook chicken and break dumplings.  Keep frozen or will stick together.  Have broth boiling and put frozen dumplings in broth all at one time.  Bring to a boil and let cook hard for a few minutes.  Do not stir hard.  Go down under dumplings with a large spoon and come up from bottom.  After a few minutes, turn heat down and let simmer about 30 minutes.	Take meat off bone and add to dumplings.
