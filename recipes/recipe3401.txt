ENGLISH MUFFIN CANAPES


6  English muffins, separated
2  cans (4 1/2 oz. each) chopped black olives
1 1/2  c. shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2  c. mayonnaise
1/2  tsp. curry powder
1/2  tsp. salt

      Mix all ingredients and pile on 12 muffin halves.  Place on a cookie sheet and freeze.  When frozen, place in baggies and return to freezer.  To serve, cut each muffin into 8 pieces.  They are easier to cut when still a little frozen.  Place on broiler pan and broil until bubbly.
      Variations:  Spread muffin halves with tomato sauce or pizza sauce.  Add pepperoni pieces, cooked sausage or browned ground chuck, or other usual pizza toppings.  In this variation, eliminate the mayonnaise, curry, and salt.
