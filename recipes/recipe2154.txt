ICE CREAM FUDGE


2  lb. light or dark bulk chocolate (not imitation)
1  pt. vanilla or butter pecan ice cream
1/2  c. chopped nuts (optional)

      Melt chocolate over lowest heat.  The microwave works well at 50% power.  Add ice cream by small spoonfuls, beating with spoon after each addition.  Add nuts, if desired.  Remove from heat. Spoon in buttered 9 x 13-inch pan.  Refrigerate until set, about 1 1/2 hours.  Keep in cool place.  When chilled, this fudge can be rolled into balls and rolled in ground nuts.  You may want to eliminate the nuts in the fudge then.
