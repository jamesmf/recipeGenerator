HAM BALL


2  cans chunky Hormel ham, drained
1  Tbsp. parsley flakes
1  tsp. mustard
1  (8 oz.) cream cheese, softened
1  tsp. mayonnaise (or enough to mix)
1  Tbsp. onion, minced fine

      Mix all ingredients.  Roll into ball.  Let cool about 1 hour, or until firm enough to be rolled in chopped nuts.
