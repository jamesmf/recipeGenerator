CHICKEN & PENNE PASTA


6  boneless, skinless chicken strips
1  lb. asparagus, ends trimmed
1  lb. penne pasta
1/4  c. virgin olive oil
1 small  bunch of green onions, chopped (include some of the green stems)
1  lb. mushrooms, sliced
1/2  lb. fresh baby spinach leaves, well-rinsed
1  ripe tomato, chopped
10  oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, julienned
  Garlic cloves, minced - to taste (optional)
  Fresh basil leaves, to taste (optional)

      Broiled or grill chicken strips with butter and Cavender's Greek spice and set aside; keep warm.  Cook the asparagus in a large pot of boiling, salted water until just tender (3-4 minutes). Remove and rinse under cold water.  Cut on the diagonal into 1 1/2 inch pieces and set aside.  Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook 10-12 minutes (or according to package directions).  While the pasta is cooking, heat half the olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat.  Add the onions and cook until soft, stirring, about 3 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and cook until slightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Add garlic (optional) and cook for 1 minute.  Then add the reserved asparagus, the spinach, tomato and sun-dried tomato; season with Cavender's, salt and pepper (to taste).
       Drain the pasta and add to the vegetables.  Toss in the remaining olive oil and basil.  Serve in large pasta bowl with chicken strips on top.
      Serves 6.
