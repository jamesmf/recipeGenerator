DEEP-FRIED TINY SQUID
(Calamaretti Fritti)  

3  lb. fresh or frozen tiny squid
1/2  c. flour
  vegetable oil for deep-frying
  salt to taste
2  to 3 lemons, cut into wedges

      Clean the squid, cutting the bodies into rings and the tentacles in half.  Dredge all the pieces by shaking them in a sturdy bag with the flour.  Bring the frying oil to a high heat (375 degrees;).  Drop the fish in a few at a time, so that the pan is full but not overcrowded.  Keep turning the pieces as they become golden and remove them with a slotted spoon when they are really crisp and thoroughly golden.  Drain on paper towels on a cookie sheet and sprinkle with salt.  Serve on a hot platter with the lemon wedges.
