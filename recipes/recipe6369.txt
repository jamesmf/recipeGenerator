MEAGHAN'S APPLE SNICKER SALAD


6  medium Granny Smith apples
1  pkg. sugar-free instant vanilla pudding (4 serving size)
1  c. skim milk
2  (16 oz.) fat-free or light whipped topping
1  bag fun size Snickers

      Peel, core and cube apples.  Chop Snickers into small pieces (remember, the less Snickers you use, the healthier the salad). Combine vanilla pudding with milk and mix until smooth.  This should be done in a large bowl.  Fold whipped topping into pudding mixture.  Add Snickers and apples and stir until Snickers and apples are coated.  Chill in refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours and serve.  Makes 6 servings.
