1 3/4  c. apple or orange juice
  a few drops of red food coloring

1  envelope Knox unflavored gelatine
6  Tbsp. sugar
2  eggs, separated
1/2  c. milk
1  c. (8 oz.) red raspberry yogurt
  red food coloring (optional)

      First Layer:  In a medium bowl, mix gelatine with 1/2 cup cold juice.  Add 1 1/4 cups boiling juice and stir until gelatine is completely dissolved.  Stir in food coloring.  Pour into an 8-cup heart shaped mold.  Chill until firm.
