RICH AND SIMPLE FRENCH ONION SOUP


4  c. sliced onions
4 (10.5 oz.)  cans beef broth
1/2  c. unsalted butter
2  Tbsp. olive oil
2  Tbsp. dry sherry (optional)
1  tsp. dried thyme
  salt and pepper to taste
1  (1 lb.) loaf French bread, sliced
6  slices Provolone cheese
3/4  c. diced Swiss cheese
1/4  c. grated Parmesan cheese

      Melt butter in an 8-quart stockpot on medium heat.  Add olive oil and stir.  Add onions and continually stir until tender and translucent.  Do not brown the onions.  Add beef stock, sherry and thyme.  Season with salt and pepper and simmer for 30 minutes. Ladle soup into individual, oven-safe, serving bowls and place one slice of bread on top (it can also be broken into pieces, whichever you prefer).  Layer cheese on top of bread, placing a slice of Provolone, 1/2 slice diced Swiss and then Parmesan cheese.  Place bowls on cookie sheet and broil until cheese bubbles and browns slightly.
