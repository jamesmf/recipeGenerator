COUNTRY RIBS


  spareribs (amount desired)
  meat tenderizer
  barbecue sauce

	Wipe the spareribs with a damp cloth and cut into sections of 4 or 5 ribs each. Sprinkle each piece generously with meat tenderizer and let set for about 10 minutes. Place in a deep pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and simmer gently for about 20 to 25 minutes until tender, or use a pressure cooker and cook until tender. Drain. Let ribs cool and marinate with Barbecue Sauce. Refrigerate overnight. Bake the next day in a slow oven, 325 degrees; to 350 degrees;, about 1 hour or until brown in a shallow baking pan. Add more sauce for extra flavor.
Barbecue Sauce:
2  Tbsp. brown sugar
1  Tbsp. paprika
1  tsp. salt
1  tsp. dry mustard
1/4  tsp. chili powder
1/8  tsp. cayenne pepper
2  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
1/4  c. catsup
1/2  c. water

	Mix above ingredients in a saucepan. Simmer 15 minutes or until slightly thickened.
	I sometimes combine above ingredients with same amount of smoked store bought barbecue sauce.
