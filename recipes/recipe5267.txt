WALDORF SALAD


4  medium sized tart apples
1 1/2  Tbsp. lemon juice
1/2  c. celery, chopped
1/2  c. raisins
1/2 to 1  c. walnuts, chopped
4  Tbsp. yogurt
2  tsp. honey
  pinch of salt
  lettuce leaves for garnish

	Core and cube apples.  (Leave skin on for color).  Pour lemon juice over apples and stir well to coat pieces and prevent them from turning brown.  Let them set 10 minutes or so while preparing other ingredients.	Combine apples, celery, raisins, and walnuts. Mix yogurt, honey and salt.  Stir until well blended.  Add dressing to apple mixture, mix well.  Can serve on lettuce leaves.  Yield: 4 -6 servings.
	Note:  We used Yoplait Very Vanilla yogurt.  Lemon would work well also.
