CHOCOLATE RAISIN CLUSTERS


12  oz. semi-sweet chocolate morsels
1 (15 oz.)  can sweetened condensed milk
2  tsp. vanilla
1/4  tsp. salt
1  lb. raisins

      Melt chocolate chips.  Blend in sweetened condensed milk. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla, salt and raisins.  Drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper.  Let harden and chill.
      Note:  Since sweetened condensed milk comes in 13 ounce cans and raisins in 15 ounce boxes these days, simply use these standard sized containers.
