KANDACE'S CHILI


1 1/2  lb. hamburger meat
1 1/2  lb. chili meat
1  large yellow onion, diced
1 large  jar of sliced jalapeno peppers (with juice), chopped
1 large  jar of Pace Picante Sauce
2 large  cans stewed tomatoes, cubed
2  cans Rotel (original)
3  cans Ranch Style beans
2  packets Lawry's Chili Seasoning

      Brown the hamburger meat, chili meat and onion, drain. Combine with the remaining ingredients in a large stock pot and simmer for 15 minutes.
      Note:  You control the "heat" by the amount of jalapeno juice you use and how hot the Picante sauce is.
