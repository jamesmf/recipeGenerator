SOPA DE AJO
(Garlic Soup; Spain)  

1/2  c. olive oil
3  c. coarsely crumbled French or Italian bread, trimmed of all crusts
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper
2  eggs, lightly beaten
2  Tbsp. finely chopped garlic
1  tsp. paprika
6  c. water
1  tsp. salt
1  Tbsp. finely chopped parsley

      In a large, heavy saucepan, warm the olive oil over low heat and add the garlic.  Stirring frequently, cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the garlic is soft, but not brown.  Stir in the crumbled bread and increase the heat to moderate and cook until the bread is golden.  Take care not to let it burn.  Stir in the paprika, then the water, cayenne pepper and salt and bring to a boil.  Reduce to low heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.  With a large wooden spoon, beat the soup until the bread is pulverized.  Slowly pour in the beaten eggs, stirring constantly.  Simmer for a few seconds. (Do not let the soup come near a boil or it will curdle.)  Taste for seasoning.  This will be a highly seasoned soup.  Add more cayenne pepper or salt if it seems too bland.  Serve at once, garnished with parsley.
