HOT WATER CORN BREAD


1  c. yellow corn meal
  vegetable oil
1/2  tsp. sea salt
  kettle of boiling water

      You will also need a skillet (cast-iron or stainless steel).
      Pour vegetable oil in skillet approximately 1/4-inch deep. Place over medium-high heat until oil is hot, but not smoking. Place meal and salt in heat resistant mixing bowl.  Add boiling water to mixture and stir.  Make mixture a thick consistency for molding patties.  Be sure all meal is moistened with the hot water*.  Mold patties by hand with mixture as hot as possible. Place patties in skillet.  Brown on both sides.  Drain on paper towels.  Yields approximately 7 to 8 patties 3-inches in diameter.
      *Because this mixture is extremely hot, run cold water over hands as needed while molding patties.  Shake off excess water.
