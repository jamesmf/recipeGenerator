STUFFED PEPPERS


4  medium green or sweet red peppers or a combination, cut in half lengthwise with seeds and membranes removed
2 (6 3/4 oz.)  cans chunk-style chicken or 2 c. chopped, cooked chicken, drained
1 (7 oz.)  can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (15 oz.)  can Spanish rice
1/4  c. frozen sliced green onions
  few dashes of bottled hot pepper sauce
1/4  c. finely shredded Cheddar cheese (1 oz.)

      Place peppers, cut side down, in a 12 x 7 1/2 x 2-inch microwave-safe baking dish.  Cover with plastic wrap and cook on 100% power (High) for 6 to 8 minutes or until nearly tender, rearranging peppers after 3 minutes; drain.  Break canned chicken into chunks.  Combine chicken, corn, Spanish rice, frozen onions and pepper sauce in a 1 1/2 quart microwave-safe casserole.  Stir until lightly mixed and cook, uncovered, on High about 6 minutes or until heated, stirring after 3 minutes.  Turn peppers cut side up and mound chicken mixture into shells.  Cook, covered, on High for 2 minutes or until heated and peppers are tender.  Sprinkle with cheese; cover and let stand until cheese melts (about 2 minutes). Makes 4 servings.
