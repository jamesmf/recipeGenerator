HOT CHILI
(Not Too Hot, Just Good)  

1  lb. ground lean meat
1 (16 oz.)  can kidney beans
1 (16 oz.)  can tomatoes, cut up
1  c. chopped onions
1  c. chopped celery
1/2  tsp. garlic powder
4  tsp. chili powder

      Brown meat in large pot.  Stir in onion and celery (I cook this for a few minutes).  Stir in tomatoes.  Add chili and garlic powder.  Add beans.  Cover and simmer for 1 hour.  This makes 4 servings.
      Each serving equals 2 vegetables, 3 meats and 1 fat.  Calories equal 350 per serving.
