FIREHOUSE BARBECUE SAUCE


4  c. ketchup
1/3  bottle (small) Worcestershire sauce
1  Tbsp. Tabasco sauce
3 1/2  oz. brown sugar
1 1/2  tsp. garlic salt or powder
1 1/2  tsp. onion salt or powder
2/3  oz. hickory smoked seasoning
2/3  oz. mustard
1/3  c. vinegar
5 1/2  oz. cooking oil
1 1/2  tsp. Accent
1/4  c. molasses
1  tsp. salt
1  tsp. pepper

      Mix and heat in saucepan; cool and store in refrigerator to be used as needed.
      Note:  The sauce is equally good with poultry, pork or beef. The sauce is quick to assemble and can be frozen. You can double or triple the recipe and it never loses its fine quality.
