OLD FASHIONED CHESS PIE


2  c. sugar
2 heaping  Tbsp. flour
1 heaping  Tbsp. yellow cornmeal
1  stick margarine, melted
3  eggs, beaten
2  tsp. vanilla
1/2  c. buttermilk
2  (9-inch) unbaked pie shells (Pet-Ritz)

      Combine sugar, flour and meal.  Mix well.  Add melted margarine; mix well.  Add beaten eggs and vanilla.  Mix well.  Add buttermilk.  Mix well.  Pour into unbaked pie shells.  Bake at 425 degrees; for 10 minutes.  Reduce temperature to 325 degrees; and cook 30 minutes more.
      You may need to put a foil "tent" over pies to keep from burning crust.  Don't let the foil touch your pie!
