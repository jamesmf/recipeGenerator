HEARTY HERBED LENTILS AND RICE


4 1/2  c. chicken broth
3/4  c. dry lentils
1  c. chopped onions
1/2  c. brown rice (raw)
1/2  c. shredded Swiss cheese
1/2  tsp. basil, salt and oregano
1/8  tsp. thyme
1/4  tsp. garlic powder
1  tsp. black pepper

      Combine all ingredients in large saucepan.  Bring to a boil; then cover.  Let simmer one hour.  Stir occasionally to prevent sticking, as nearly all the liquid will be absorbed by lentils and rice.  Serves 4.
      Alternate methods:  Bake 1 hour.  Cook in crock-pot on low 8 to 10 hours; stir once.
