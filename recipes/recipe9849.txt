SQUASH HUSH PUPPIES


2  c. grated squash
1/4  c. chopped onion
2  Tbsp. sugar
1  egg
2  Tbsp. soft butter
  salt and pepper to taste

      Mix all ingredients well and add enough flour to meal to make batter thick enough to drop by teaspoons into hot grease.  Cook until golden brown.  These are very good and do not taste at all like squash!
