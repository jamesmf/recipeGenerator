BACON & CHEESE ROLL-UPS


1  lb. bacon

      Cut crust off bread.  Save crust to feed birds or ducks.  Cut bread in half.  Spread a small amount of Cheese Whiz on each piece of bread.  Roll up tightly.  Cut each slice of bacon into 3 or 4 pieces.  Wrap the bacon around each roll and secure with a toothpick.  Bake on a cookie sheet for 10 to 15 minutes at 400 degrees.  Serve hot.  If needed, you can freeze these and then reheat at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.
