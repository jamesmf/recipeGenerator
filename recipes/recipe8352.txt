SPAETZLE  (GERMAN DUMPLINGS) AND CHICKEN

Spaetzle:
4  eggs
2 1/2  c. flour
1/2  c. water
1/2  c. milk
1  tsp. salt

	Beat eggs and add other ingredients. Beat until batter blisters. Drop in boiling water or broth using butter knife. (Dip butter knife in boiling water every few dumplings to keep from sticking to knife.) Skim as they rise. Place in a container with a little butter.
Chicken:
6  to 8 chicken pieces
8  c. water (to make broth)
1  c. flour (approximately)
  onions, fried (optional)

	Boil chicken (I use thighs) in about 8 cups water until it falls off the bone. Remove chicken from pan to cool. Strain broth. Debone chicken and remove skins. Season chicken with your favorite seasonings. (I use Sazon or Mrs. Dash, garlic and pepper.) Mix seasoned chicken with flour.
	 In a frying pan, saut√© onions with a little oil or butter to add extra flavor to the chicken. Remove onions and fry chicken. Add chicken, onions and dumplings to broth. Simmer for about 1/2 hour.
