"QUICK AND EASY" FLAME CHARRED STEAK



4  (16 oz.) tail-less T-bone steaks, cut 3/4 to 1-inch thick

 
Sauce:
1  stick margarine (4 oz.)
1/4  c. Worcestershire sauce
1/4  c. A.1. steak sauce
3  Tbsp. steak seasoning
1  Tbsp. garlic powder
3  Tbsp. lemon juice

      To prepare sauce, combine all sauce ingredients in a small saucepan.  Heat over low heat until margarine is melted; mix well. Brush both sides of steak with sauce.  Cover for 30 minutes, reserving remaining sauce for basting.
      Heat charcoal (or gas) grill until coals are white ash.  (When coals are spread they should cover an area at least 1/4 larger than the area covered by the steaks.)  Place basted steaks on the hot grid, 2 to 3-inches from heat.  Allow coals to flame, charring steaks on each side, approximately 1 minute on each side.  Grill 3 to 4-inches from heat, basting with remaining sauce, about 4 to 5 minutes each side, turning only once.
