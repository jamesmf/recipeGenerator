POTATO SOUP


6  large potatoes, peeled and cut into medium chunks
2  large onions, cut small
2  to 3 carrots, cut small
1/2  tsp. garlic powder
  parsley
  salt and pepper to taste

      Place potatoes and onions in a large pot with enough water to cover vegetables at least 2 inches. Cook until potatoes are well done.  Drain off liquid. Reserve. Mash potatoes and onions thoroughly.  Add reserved potato water plus 1 or 2 cups more water.  Stir well. Add carrots, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Simmer until carrots are tender.  Garnish with parsley and add to soup. Serves 6 to 8.
      Experiment with your favorite herbs to vary flavor.  Soup thickens as it cools.  A little more water may be necessary when reheating.
