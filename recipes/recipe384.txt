INDIVIDUAL BAKED ALASKAS


1 (8 oz.)  can unsweetened pineapple slices, drained
2  c. raspberry sherbet
3  egg whites (room temperature)
1/8  tsp. cream of tartar
3  Tbsp. sugar
1/4  tsp. almond extract

      Place pineapple slices  on  a Pam-sprayed baking sheet. Freeze until firm.  After frozen,  top each slice with a scoop of sherbet and freeze again  until  firm.  Beat egg whites and cream of tartar until  foamy  (using  high  speed  on electric mixer). Gradually add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat until stiff peaks form and  sugar  is  dissolved  (2 to 4 minutes).  Fold in extract.
      Spread meringue  over  frozen  sherbet  and  pineapple, making sure  to  seal  edges.  Cover  loosely  and  refreeze. Remove from freezer and broil  6  inches  from  heat  1  to  2 minutes or until  lightly golden.  Serve immediately.  Makes 4 individual servings.
