1  bunch of green onions, chopped
4  to 5 regular mushrooms, diced

      In large skillet, melt butter.  Baste mushroom caps with butter and place on baking sheet.  Baste inside of caps with butter.  In skillet with remainder of butter, sauté vegetables. When about half done, add chicken and finish sautéing, adding Worcestershire Sauce.  Spoon filling into caps.  Top with a liberal amount of your favorite type of shredded cheese. Either in oven or on the grill, heat mushrooms just until cheese melts, then serve warm.
