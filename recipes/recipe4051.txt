TORTILLA ROLL-UPS


1  pkg. of 8 flour tortillas, burrito size
16  oz. cream cheese, softened
1/2  pkg. Ranch party dip mix, dry
1 small  jar pimientos
3  to 4 jalapenos, diced

      Mix the last 4 ingredients together.  Place each tortilla on a piece of aluminum foil approximately 12 inches long.  Spoon a large dollop into the center of each tortilla.  Spread the mixture over the tortilla, covering as much tortilla as possible.  Roll the tortillas tightly, from one side to the other.  Wrap in foil and refrigerate for several hours.  Overnight would be the best, allowing the flavors to blend.  Before serving, remove and discard the foil.  Slice the tortillas into 1 inch rounds and serve.
