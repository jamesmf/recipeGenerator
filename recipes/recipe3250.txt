TUNA MOUSSE


1  envelope Unflavored Gelatin
2  TBSP Lemon Juice
1  slice of onion - 1 inch thick
1/2  cup boiling water
1/2  cup mayonnaise
2 - 7  ounce cans of Tuna in water
1  tsp dill
1/4  tsp paprika
1  cup Sour Cream

      In a blender or food processor, combine the gelatin, lemon juice, onion and boiling water and blend thoroughly.  Add mayonnaise, tuna, paprika and dill - blend again.  Add sour cream and blend making sure the mixture is smooth and that the sour cream has all been incorporated.  Turn mixture into a lightly oiled 3 1/2 cup mold (I use a fish shaped mold).  Chill until firm, preferably overnight and unmold on a platter (it helps to loosen the edge with a small sharp knife).  Garnish with parsley, black olives, green olives, radishes and lemons (I use a small piece of a sliced green olive with pimento for fish's eye.)  Surround the bottom of the tray with party sized pumpernickel or rye bread slices or crackers.
      NOTE:  You may substitute salmon or crab for the tuna if you wish.
