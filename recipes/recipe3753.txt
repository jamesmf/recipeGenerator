1  medium eggplant
2  cloves garlic, minced
3  tbsp. oil
  Salt to taste
  Juice of 2 lemons
2  tbsp. water
1/2  c. tahini paste

      Cut 1 inch slits in eggplant to prevent splattering while baking.  Bake at 500 degrees; until tender.  Split eggplant open and scoop inside pulp together with juice.  Mix tahini, garlic, lemon juice and salt to make sauce.  Add water if needed to make a thick sauce.  Add mashed eggplant.  Put in salad bowl and pour oil on top.
