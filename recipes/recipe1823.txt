CHILI RELLENOS APPETIZERS


2 (4 oz.)  cans mild chilies, chopped
3  c. shredded Jack cheese
2  eggs
1 1/2  c. shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
2  Tbsp. milk
1  Tbsp. flour

      In a lightly greased 9-inch square pan, make layers of chilies and the cheeses, starting and ending with cheeses.  Beat eggs, milk and flour together.  Pour over layered ingredients and bake at 375 degrees; about 1 hour or until firm.  Cut into small squares and serve warm. These come out fairly flat and can be picked up with fingers. Makes 16.
