FROZEN FRUIT SALAD


1  can Bing cherries
1  can chunk pineapple
10  oz. pkg. miniature marshmallows
8  oz. cream cheese
1/2  pt. whipped cream (can use Cool Whip)
8  Tbsp. powdered sugar
1  c. chopped nuts

      Mix some of the juice from Bing cherries with cream cheese until very soft (not runny). Add remaining ingredients. Mix by hand. Be sure to cut cherries and pineapple in halves before mixing. I always double this recipe. Put in molds, clear glass containers, etc. Cover with foil and freeze.
