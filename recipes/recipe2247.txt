SANDRA'S BLACKENED CATFISH


1/4  c. lemon juice
1/2  tsp. paprika
1/4  tsp. oregano
1/4  tsp. thyme
2  Tbsp. butter
1/4  tsp. garlic powder
1/2  tsp. parsley flakes
  dash of Worcestershire sauce
2  whole catfish or 4 fillets

      Use pond-raised catfish fillets.  I personally like the 3 to 5-ounce size, if you have a choice.  My son, John, buys them from one of the ponds in Mississippi in a 15-pound box and I keep them in the freezer.  Take out the number of fillets you think you will need and thaw in cold water.  When thawed, drain water off fish and pat lightly with paper towels.  Don't get them too dry or they won't hold the batter well.  Mix the amount of white cornmeal you think you will need with salt and black or red pepper to taste.  I sometimes put just a sprinkling of garlic powder in, too.  Dredge fish in this mixture on both sides, making sure the whole surface is well covered.  Lay on a cookie sheet, in layers, with paper towels between each layer.  Keep in refrigerator until ready to cook.
