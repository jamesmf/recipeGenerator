BARBECUE CORN


6  ears corn
1/2  c. butter or margarine
3  Tbsp. bottled barbecue sauce
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper

      Husk corn and remove silk.  Place each ear on a double thick sheet of foil.  Melt butter or margarine in a small pan; stir in barbecue sauce, salt and pepper.  Brush over corn.  Wrap corn in foil; twist ends to seal and place in large shallow pan.  Bake at 400 degrees; for 25 minutes, turning often.  Serve from foil wrappers.  To cook corn outdoors, place foil wrapped ears on grill over hot coals.  Grill 15 to 25 minutes, turning often.
