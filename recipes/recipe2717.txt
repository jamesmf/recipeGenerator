KULICH


1 1/2  c. milk, scalded
2  pkg. dry yeast
1/4  c. lukewarm water
4  c. flour
4  egg yolks
2/3  c. sugar
1  c. melted butter, cooled
2/3  c. diced almonds
2  lemons, grated peel
1/4  tsp. salt
  pinch of saffron
1 3/4  c. flour
1/3  c. golden raisins
  pinch of cardamon

      Scald milk; remove scum.  Pour into large mixing bowl; cool to lukewarm.  Dissolve yeast in water and let stand 5 minutes.  Add to milk.  Add 4 cups flour, 1 at a time.  Mix thoroughly.  Cover and let rise until double in size (about 1 1/2 hours).  Beat yolks with sugar, until light and thick.  Stir into dough.  Add butter, saffron, cardamon (optional), peel and salt; mix well.  Gradually stir in flour (1 3/4 cups) to make the dough just firm enough to handle.
      Turn dough out on floured board and knead it until it is firm enough to handle without sticking.  Add almonds and raisins. Divide dough into 3 parts.  Shape and drop into 1-pound greased coffee cans.  Let dough rise in warm place until it reaches top of can.  Bake in 350 degrees; oven for 45 minutes.  When cooled, drizzle with a glaze of powdered sugar, lemon and drop of water.  Sprinkle with colored candy beads.
