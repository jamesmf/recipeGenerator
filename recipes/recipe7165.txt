STUFFED CHICKEN BREASTS IN WINE SAUCE


2  Chicken Breasts
1/2  cup Wheat Germ
1/4  cup Green onions (chopped)
1  tbsp sun-dried tomatoes, oil packed, (chopped)
1/2  tsp basil
1/4  tsp garlic powder
1  tbsp chicken stock
2  tbsp all purpose flour
3/4  cup dry white wine
1/2  cup half and half
5  tbsp margarine

      Combine the wheat germ, onions, sun-dried tomatoes, basil and garlic powder.  Add 1/4 cup melted margarine.  Set aside.
      Mix chicken stock and flour, gradually add the wine and half and half, stirring until smooth.  Blend 1 tbsp of wine mixture with the wheat germ mixture.  Reserve the remaining sauce.
      Separate the whole chicken breasts so you will have 4 pieces. Cover chicken with waxed paper and pound flat.  Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces.  Place 1/4 of the wheat germ mixture on each chicken piece, roll up carefully and fasten with toothpicks.
       Melt 1 tbsp margarine in a skillet and brown the roll-ups on each side.  Transfer to a baking dish with cover.  Pour the remaining sauce over the chicken, cover and bake in preheated 400 degree oven for 40 - 45 minutes.  Remove toothpicks and serve.
