CUSTARD ICE CREAM


1  qt. milk
1  qt. cream
2/3  c. sugar
1/8  tsp. salt
3  beaten eggs
2  tsp. vanilla

      Heat milk in top of double boiler; do not boil.  Stir in sugar. Beat eggs with salt; blend in a little of the hot milk mixture. Add to remaining milk and continue cooking, stirring constantly, until smooth and creamy.  Strain if necessary.  Pour in mixing bowl; add cream and vanilla.
      In freezer, mix 1 part ice cream salt to 8 parts finely crushed ice, making sure salt and ice are well mixed.  Turn milk mixture, which has been poured into freezer container, occasionally removing container to scrape down ice cream from sides.  Continue until ice cream is creamy-smooth.
      To adapt for freezer, decrease sugar to 1/3 cup.  Freeze slowly to a mush; remove to bowl and beat until smooth, but not liquid. Return to trays and freeze.  This isn't quite as good as the kind made in a hand or electric freezer.
Variations:

      One-half cup honey blended with 4 tablespoons flour and enough cold milk to make a paste may be used instead of sugar.
      For a change in flavor, use dark brown or maple sugar.
      After partly frozen, mashed or crushed fruit (2 mashed bananas blended with 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 1 cup drained, crushed pineapple, peaches, etc.) may be added.  Crumbled cookies could also be added.
