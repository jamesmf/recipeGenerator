MARINATED SHRIMP


1 1/2  tsp. minced garlic
1 1/2  tsp. minced shallots
1 1/2  tsp. Dijon mustard
1/3  c. dry white wine
1/3  c. fresh lemon juice
3/4  c. olive oil
1/3  c. chopped fresh basil
24  large shrimp

      Combine all ingredients, except shrimp.  Stir to blend.  Add shrimp and stir to coat.  Let stand until ready to cook.
      Put grill on high.  Take out shrimp and put on skewer so they will lay flat.  Cook three minutes, turn, and then cook two minutes.  Arrange symmetrically and spoon sauce over shrimp.  Serve with rice and stir-fried vegetables.
