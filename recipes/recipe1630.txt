RYE BREAD
(Rugbrod)  

3 1/2  oz. yeast
1  pt. buttermilk
3 to 4  Tbsp. buttermilk
3 to 4  Tbsp. water
  about 1 3/4 lb. rye flour
1  tsp. salt

      All the ingredients should be at room temperature before baking.
      Heat the buttermilk and water until lukewarm.  Stir in the yeast and gradually add the salt and flour.  Knead until smooth and shiny, adding a little more water if necessary.  Cover with a damp cloth and leave to rise in a warm place for 2 hours with no draft.
      When risen, knead lightly.  Transfer to a greased form and set aside for 1 hour to rise again, covering with a damp cloth.  Brush with water and bake at 400 degrees; for about 1 1/4 hours, brushing now and again with water during the baking.
