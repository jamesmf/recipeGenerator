Mock "Fried Chicken"


1  lb. firm tofu, diced 1/4 to 1/8-inch thick
1  Tbsp. soy sauce plus 2 to 3 Tbsp. water (enough of this mixture to cover marinade dish)
3  Tbsp. vegetable oil (may need to add more)
1/3  c. nutritional yeast flakes
  onion powder (approximately 1/8 tsp.)
  cayenne to taste

      Make a light paste with all of the ingredients, except tofu and oil.  Marinate tofu for a few minutes, turning occasionally.  Heat skillet with oil until hot.
Dry Mixture:
  unbleached white flour*
  salt and cayenne to taste
  nutritional yeast flakes*

      *Flour ration should be approximately 4 to 1 yeast flakes.
      Dredge tofu in flour mixture.  Fry tofu until brown on both sides.  Drain on paper towels.  This mock "fried chicken" can be eaten as "cold chicken" after refrigeration.
