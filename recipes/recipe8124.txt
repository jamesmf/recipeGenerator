BAKED SPAGHETTI


1 (1 lb.)  box spaghetti
2  eggs
1/2  c. margarine
3/4  c. Parmesan cheese
1  lb. ground beef

      Make your own spaghetti sauce that you like and set aside. Boil spaghetti noodles; drain.  Mix eggs, Parmesan cheese and melted margarine in a bowl and add to spaghetti noodles.  Mix completely.  Grease a baking dish.  Pour spaghetti noodles in baking dish and press gently to form like a crust in dish.  Pour spaghetti sauce over noodles (do not stir).  Poke holes down through spaghetti noodles to allow some of the sauce to seep through.  Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees; for about 25 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese on top.  Return to oven for 5 more minutes to melt cheese.  Allow to cool about 15 minutes before serving.  Serves 6 to 8 people.
