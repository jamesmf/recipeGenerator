CARROT SALAD


1 (6 oz.)  box orange jello
4  c. shredded carrots
1  c. diced celery (optional)
1 small  can pineapple (optional)

      Make  jello  according  to directions on package.  (Use 1/2 cup less water.) Stir in remaining  ingredients.  Set  in refrigerator until set.
      Note:  When I use pineapple, I use the juice of pineapple for part of the cold water you add to jello.
