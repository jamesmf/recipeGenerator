SPINACH SALAD


1  bag spinach
1 1/2  c. bean sprouts
1/4  c. bacon, chopped
1  can water chestnuts, chopped
2  boiled eggs, chopped
2  Tbsp. chopped onion or slices of purple onion

 
Dressing:
1  c. oil
1/2  c. apple cider vinegar (I used balsamic and less sugar)

      This is enough for 2 salads. I also used a can of small oranges.
