GREEK CHICKEN


1/4  lb. Feta cheese, crumbled (about 1 c.)
1  Tbsp. lemon juice
1  tsp. dried oregano leaves
6  large skinless boneless chicken breast halves (about 2 lb.)
3/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
  all-purpose flour
2  Tbsp. olive or salad oil
1  tsp. chicken-flavor instant bouillon
1  medium-size tomato, diced
1/2 small  bunch spinach, sliced (about 2 c. loosely packed)

      About 40 minutes before serving, in small bowl with fork, mix Feta cheese, lemon juice and oregano until smooth. On work surface, with meat mallet or dull edge of French knife, pound each chicken breast half to 1/2-inch thickness. With knife or small metal spatula, spread cheese mixture over each breast half to within 1/2-inch of edge. Fold chicken breasts crosswise in half to enclose filling; secure with toothpick. On sheet of waxed paper, mix salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon flour; use to coat chicken. In 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat in hot olive or salad oil, cook chicken until golden brown on both sides, turning once.
      Meanwhile, in cup, mix chicken-flavor instant bouillon, 1 tablespoon flour and 1 cup water until smooth. To chicken in skillet, add flour mixture, tomato and spinach; over high heat, heat to boiling. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 8 to 10 minutes, until chicken is fork-tender.
