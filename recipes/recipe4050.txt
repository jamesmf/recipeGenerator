CHILE CON QUESO


1 16  oz. Velveeta
3/4  c. whole milk
1  green Anaheim pepper, seeded and diced, about 1 1/2 cup
1/4  c. diced white onion
1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
2  tsp. minced cilantro
  juice of 1 lime
1/4  tsp. dried oregano
1/4  tsp. ground black pepper, freshly ground is best
  pinch of salt
  pinch of dried thyme
2  medium tomatoes, seeded and diced, about 2/3 cup
1/4  c. ranchero cheese, crumbled
  tortilla chips

      Combine Velveeta and milk in a medium saucepan over medium/low heat.  Stir often as cheese melts.  Be careful not to burn it.  When cheese is melted, add the remaining ingredients, but not the tomatoes.  Continue to cook over medium/low heat for 7 minutes, stirring often to prevent burning.  Stir in tomatoes and remove queso from heat.  Pour queso into a serving dish, top with crumbled ranchero cheese and serve with tortilla chips for dipping.  Makes about 2 cups.
