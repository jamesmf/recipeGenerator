LEMON-GARLIC CHICKEN


5  cloves garlic, chopped
3/4  c. lemon juice
1  Tbsp. salt
1/2  Tbsp. pepper
1  Tbsp. oregano
1/4 to 1/2  c. oil
8  to 10 pieces chicken

      Combine first 6 ingredients for marinade.  Marinate chicken overnight (or all day).  Cook chicken on grill, basting with marinade.
      Or  may broil or bake in oven, as you would normally do chicken.  Bake  at  400 degrees; for about 30 to 40 minutes.  Baste as desired.
