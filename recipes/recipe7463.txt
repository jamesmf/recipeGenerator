BROTHER JOHN'S BEEF STEW


1  large onion, chopped
  vegetable oil
2  lb. beef for stew, cut into 2-inch chunks
3  Tbsp. flour
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
3  Tbsp. beef bouillon powder
1  lb. carrots, peeled and cut into bite-size chunks
4  large potatoes, peeled and cut into bite-size chunks
1  c. frozen peas

      In a 5-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat, in 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, cook onions, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes; with slotted spoon remove to bowl.  In a large bowl, toss beef with flour, salt, and pepper. In the same Dutch oven, over high heat in 2 tablespoons hot oil, cook beef, half at a time, until well browned on all sides.  With slotted spoon, remove beef to another bowl as it browns.
      Return beef to Dutch oven; add beef-flavor bouillon and 4 cups water.  Over high heat, heat to boiling.  Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours or until beef is almost fork-tender. Add onions, carrots, and potatoes to Dutch oven; over high heat, heat to boiling.  Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 1 hour longer until beef and vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally.  Stir in peas; heat through.  Makes about 8 servings.  Serve with freshly baked corn bread.
