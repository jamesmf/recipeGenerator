SEASONING SALT


2  Tbsp. salt
2  tsp. sugar
1/2  tsp. paprika
1/4  tsp. turmeric
1/2  tsp. onion powder
1/2  tsp. garlic, granulated

      Mix all ingredients well and store in an airtight container.
      Use this spice blend on meats and vegetables. It also makes a quick "dry rub" for meats that are going to be smoked.
