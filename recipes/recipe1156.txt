GREEN BEANS WITH SUNFLOWER SEEDS


1  lb. fresh green beans
1/2  c. chopped onions
1  tsp. minced garlic
1/8  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. pepper
  shake of red pepper, crushed (optional)
1/3  c. water
3  Tbsp. sunflower seeds
1/4  tsp. oregano

      Snap ends off beans and break into 1/2-inch lengths.  If very young, leave whole.  Wash and place in pan.  Sprinkle onion, garlic, salt and pepper over beans.  Add water.  Cover tightly and cook on high until steaming; reduce heat and cook about 20 minutes until beans are crisp-tender.  Pour off excess liquid.  Sprinkle sunflower seeds and oregano over beans.  Mix lightly.
