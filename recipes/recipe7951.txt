HAM AND CHEESE BAKED FRITTATA


6  Tbsps. Crisco oil
4  cups frozen shredded potatoes
1 1/2  tsp. salt, divided
1/2  tsp. ground pepper
1  lb. baked ham, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
12  eggs
6  Tbsp. milk
1/2  tsp. Italian seasoning
2  cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1  1/2 cups chunky salsa, heated

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Heat Crisco oil in 10-12 inch skillet on medium heat.  Add potatoes.  Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp. salt and pepper.  Cook 8 minutes or until almost brown.  Add ham. Cook 2-3 minutes more.  Turn occasionally with spatula.  Blend eggs with milk, Italian seasoning and remaining 1 tsp. salt while potatoes are cooking.  Place the potatoes into a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish sprayed with non-stick cooking spray and stir the eggs into the potatoes.  Bake covered at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.  Remove from oven.  Sprinkle with cheese and return to oven.  Bake 15 minutes more or until cheese is melted and eggs are set.  Turn oven to broil and continue to cook about 2 minutes, or until top is nicely browned.  Allow to cool 10 minutes before cutting into 8 squares.  Serve topped with heated salsa.
