CHEESY ONION MUFFINS


1 1/2  c. biscuit mix (packaged)
1/2  c. all-purpose flour
3  Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese
1  Tbsp. dried minced onion
2  Tbsp. snipped fresh parsley or 2 tsp. dried parsley flakes
1  egg white
3/4  c. skim milk

      In a medium mixing bowl, stir together biscuit mix, flour, Parmesan cheese, dried onion and parsley.  Beat egg white with milk and stir into dry ingredients until just moistened.  Fill muffin cups half full (should have been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray first).  Bake at 400 degrees; for 15 to 20 minutes.  You should be able to stick a toothpick in the center and have it come out clean. Makes 12 muffins.
