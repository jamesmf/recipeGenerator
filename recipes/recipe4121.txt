CHICKEN ALMOND SPREAD


1 (3 oz.)  pkg. cream cheese
1/2  tsp. celery salt
1/2  tsp. onion salt
1  tsp. Worcestershire sauce
  dash of Tabasco
1/3  c. sour cream
1/3  c. finely snipped parsley
1/4  c. toasted almonds, chopped
1/2  c. cooked chicken
1 (3 oz.)  can mushrooms, chopped

      Several hours or the day before serving, mix softened cream cheese, celery salt, onion salt, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, parsley and sour cream.  Stir in chicken, mushrooms and almonds, all finely chopped.  Place in a dish that will mold the spread.  Refrigerate until chilled.  This allows all flavors to blend.  Unmold spread and sprinkle with paprika.  Serve with assorted crackers.
