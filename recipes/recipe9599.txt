GRILLED PORK TENDERLOIN


1  Tbsp. vegetable oil
1  c. chopped onion
5  Tbsp. sugar
1 1/2  c. dry red wine
3/4  c. reduced-sodium soy sauce
1/4  c. balsamic vinegar
2 1/2  Tbsp. chopped, peeled, fresh ginger
1/2  tsp. ground black pepper
3  (14 to 16 oz.) pork tenderloins
3 medium, fresh peaches, peeled and sliced or 1  can sliced, drained peaches
2  Tbsp. chopped, fresh chives

      To make marinade and sauce:  Heat oil in medium saucepan; add onions and sugar. Saut√© until onions are golden (6 minutes). Mix in wine and next 5 ingredients. Cook 1 minute longer.  Remove from heat; cool completely.
      Place tenderloins in heavy Ziploc bag.  Pour 1 cup cooled marinade into bag. Seal.  Refrigerate 6 hours. Cover remaining sauce separately and refrigerate.
      Prepare grill (medium heat). Remove pork from marinade; discard this marinade. Grill until meat thermometer registers 155 degrees; (35 minutes) when inserted into tenderloin.
      Meanwhile, boil remaining marinade until reduced by 1/2. Slice meat in thin slices; place on platter. Place peaches on top. Pour sauce over top.
