COMPANY POT ROAST


1/4  c. corn oil
4  lb. chuck roast
1  c. chopped onion
1  c. sliced celery
2  garlic cloves, minced
3  c. beef bouillon
1/4  c. catsup
1  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. dried thyme
2  small bay leaves
1/4  tsp. black pepper
6  medium potatoes, peeled and quartered
4  carrots, cut in 2-inch pieces
1/2  lb. whole green beans
6  very small onions, left whole
1/4  c. cornstarch

      In large Dutch oven over medium heat, brown roast in corn oil. Add the next 8 ingredients.  Bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat and simmer for at least 2 hours.  Add potatoes and carrots. Simmer 30 minutes.  Add green beans and whole onions.  Simmer 10 to 15 minutes, until beans and onion are tender-crisp.  Remove roast to a large platter, arrange vegetables around the roast.
      Combine cornstarch and 1/4 cup water.  Stir until smooth.  Add to liquid in Dutch oven.  Boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly, to thicken.  Serve gravy over roast and vegetables.  (Remember to remove bay leaves before serving.)
