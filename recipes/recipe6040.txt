SWEET RED PEPPER SALAD


6  medium sweet red peppers
1/2  c. olive oil or vegetable oil
1/4  c. chopped fresh parsley
2  to 3 garlic cloves, minced
1/2  tsp. dried oregano
1/4  tsp. salt
  lettuce leaves, optional

      Place whole peppers on a broiler pan; broil 4 inches from the heat until the skins blister, about 2 to 3 minutes.  With tongs, rotate pepper slightly; broil until all sides are blistered and lightly blackened.  Place pepper in a brown paper bag; close bag and let stand for 15 to 20 minutes.  Peel off the charred skin and discard; remove stem and seeds.  Cut peppers into 1/4 inch wide strips.  In a shallow container, combine the oil, parsley, garlic, oregano and salt; add peppers and toss.  Cover and chill for 3 to 4 hours.  Serve on lettuce leaves if desired.  Yield: 6 servings.
       Note: Salad may also be spooned onto toasted garlic bread and served as an appetizer.
