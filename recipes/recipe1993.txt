DULCE DE CALABAZA
(Also Known As Candied Pumpkin)  

1  pumpkin, cut in uniform pieces (peeled with center removed)

      Soak pumpkin overnight in lime water (water should cover pumpkin).  To make lime water, dissolve 1 tablespoon quick lime to 1 quart cold water.
      The next day, remove pumpkin from lime water and wash 3 times in clear water.  Cover pumpkin with warm water and bring to boiling point, boiling for 5 minutes.  Drain pumpkin and wash twice in clear cold water.  Allow pumpkin to drain 1 hour.  Pierce each piece in several places with a fork.  This allows the sugar syrup to penetrate when cooking.
      Weigh pumpkin and use equal amount of sugar when cooking. Place pumpkin in pot and cover pumpkin with sugar.  Moisten sugar with water and cook over a very slow fire until pumpkin becomes crystallized, approximately 3 hours at 300 degrees;.
