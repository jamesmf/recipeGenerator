MUSHROOMS WITH CRABMEAT STUFFING


100  mushroom caps
1  cup mushroom stems, finely chopped
1  cup onion, finely chopped
1/2  cup butter
1  cup celery, finely chopped
1  1/2 cups breadcrumbs
1/4  cup dried parsley
2  cans (6 1/2 oz) White crabmeat
  granulated garlic to taste
  salt and pepper to taste

      Saut√© stems, onions and celery in butter until celery is tender.  Pour into a large bowl.  Add breadcrumbs, parsley, white crabmeat, garlic, salt & pepper.  Mix well and add more melted butter if too dry.  Lightly blanch mushroom caps.  Drain and cool. Form small balls of stuffing and insert into each cap.  (In forming balls, stuffing should not stick to your hands.)  Lightly sprinkle with garlic.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden.  (Excess stuffing may be frozen or formed into crab patties and baked.)
