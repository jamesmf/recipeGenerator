BONBONS


1/3  c. unsulphured molasses
2/3  c. dry skim milk
1/3  c. fine graham crackers

      Pour molasses into a mixing bowl.  Stir in dry milk and graham cracker crumbs.  Mix together with hands until candy holds together.  Shape into little balls and roll in chocolate sprinkles, coconut, nuts or graham cracker crumbs.
      These are excellent for children to help make.
