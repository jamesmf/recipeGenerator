6  Tbsp. oil
6  Tbsp. flour
2  c. chopped onion
1  c. chopped celery
1  c. chopped bell pepper
1  c. chopped green onion
1/4  tsp. cayenne

2  bay leaves
1  tsp. black pepper

      First, you make a roux! Heat oil in a large heavy pot. Stir in flour. Stir constantly over low heat for about 20 to 30 minutes until roux is a medium brown color. Add onion, celery, bell pepper and green onion. Saut until limp. Add garlic, tomato sauce, tomatoes, bay leaves, black pepper, thyme, basil, salt and cayenne. Cook 15 minutes. Add Worcestershire and water; bring to a boil. Add shrimp and simmer about 30 minutes. Serve over rice. This dish improves upon resting several hours.
