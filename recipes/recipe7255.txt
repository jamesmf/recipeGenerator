MEXICAN CHICKEN


1 1/2  lb. boneless chicken breasts
2  c. chicken broth
2  cans cream of chicken soup (low-fat)
1  can Ro-Tel tomatoes and green chilies
1  c. Tostitos brand salsa con queso or Cheez Whiz (for less tang)
1  large bag taco flavored Doritos (14 oz.; low-fat if you can find it)**

      Cook chicken.* Cool, debone and cut into bite size pieces. Combine soups, chicken broth and tomatoes. Mix with chicken in a 9 x 13-inch pan or baking dish. Crush Doritos into small pieces and stir in. Spoon salsa con queso on top and bake in 350 degrees; oven for 30 minutes. I like to serve extra chips with it at the table.
      *I cook my chicken with onion, celery, a bay leaf and 2 cloves. Then I use the broth from the cooked chicken for my chicken broth in this recipe.
      **I use most of the bag, but reserve some to eat with the meal. Sometimes I mix half a bag of low-fat tortilla chips with half a bag of Doritos. (A little less fat that way.)
