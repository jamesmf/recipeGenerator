TOMATO RICE SOUP


1/4  c. margarine
1  tsp. minced garlic
1/4  c. flour
1 1/2  c. nonfat dry milk
1/4  c. tomato paste
1  tsp. dried basil
3/4  c. chopped white onion
1/4  c. chopped green onion
4  c. chicken stock
1 (9 oz.)  can tomatoes, diced (undrained)
1 1/2  c. cooked rice

      In a large saucepan, melt margarine over medium heat. Saut√© onions and garlic until onions are soft. Off heat, stir in flour to make a roux. Return to heat and stir for about 5 minutes.
      Meanwhile, heat chicken stock. Gradually combine nonfat dry milk with warm stock, stirring well to dissolve lumps. Slowly add to roux, stirring constantly to avoid lumping. Continue until all liquid is well combined, smooth and begins to thicken. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, basil and rice. Simmer about 15 minutes. Makes 8 servings.
