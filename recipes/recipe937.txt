FISH AND CHIPS



1 1/2  lb. fresh fish fillets (sole, flounder, haddock or cod)
2  eggs, separated
1/2  c. beer
1/4  c. milk
1  c. all-purpose flour
1/2  tsp. seasoned salt
1/4  tsp. seasoned pepper

      Cut fillets into pieces, about 3 x 1 1/2-inches.  Place on paper towels to dry.  Beat egg yolks until thick and light. Blend in beer, milk, flour and seasonings.  Mix until smooth. Beat egg whites stiff but not dry; fold in.  Pat fillets dry.  Dip into batter, a few pieces at a time; lift out and drain slightly with fork or slotted spoon.  Fry in deep fat heated to 375 degrees; for 2 to 3 minutes until golden brown and puffed.  Drain on absorbent paper.  Serve with French fried potatoes.
