LA~RUES  APPLE CONGEALED SALAD


3  c. cranberry juice cocktail
1 (15 oz.)  can crushed pineapple
1 large  box lemon Jell-O
1/2  c. chopped nuts
3  c. finely chopped apples

	Heat 1 cup juice to boiling and dissolve Jell-O in it. Stir in remaining juice and chill until partially set. Fold in remaining ingredients and pour into a 7 x 13 x 12 Pyrex dish. Chill until firm. Serve on lettuce or plain.
	Note:  I added a package of unflavored gelatin. This makes it easier to cut into squares. We use this for a fall luncheon, but it's really good any time.
