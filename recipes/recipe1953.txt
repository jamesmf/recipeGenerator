VEGETABLE QUESADILLA COMBINATION


1 medium onion or 1  bunch green onions
1  bell pepper
3 to 4  Tbsp. butter
1 (6 oz.)  can sliced mushrooms or 4 to 6 fresh large mushrooms, sliced
1/4  tsp. salt or to taste
6  oz. Cheddar cheese, shredded
6  oz. Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
8  (8-inch) flour tortillas
8  slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
1 (2 oz.)  jar diced pimientos

      Sauté onion and bell pepper in butter until barely tender.  Add mushrooms and sauté until mushrooms just start to darken as they absorb the butter.  Mix in salt and set aside.  Combine Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese.  Place 4 tortillas on lightly buttered or oiled rectangular pancake griddle; let them warm through (you can tell by just touching them lightly with your finger), then turn each one over.  Top the 4 tortillas with the filling mixture as follows:  First, half of the cheese, vegetable mixture, bacon, pimientos and sliced ripe olives (optional), then the remaining cheese.  Put another tortilla on top of each.  Cook until bottom starts to brown and cheese starts to melt.
      Mash each quesadilla down from time to time with a spatula to help the cheese adhere to both tortillas.  With 2 spatulas (one on top and one slipped under the bottom tortilla), grasp the "sandwich" and flip it over; cook until brown on second side. Remove from griddle; cut into quarters and arrange on shredded lettuce.
      Note:  If using an electric griddle, set temperature to 350 degrees;.
