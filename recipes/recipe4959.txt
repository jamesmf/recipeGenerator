CABERNET CRANBERRY SAUCE


1 1/4  c. sugar
1  c. dry red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot)
1  pkg. (12-oz.) fresh cranberries
2  tsp. grated orange rind
1  (3-inch) cinnamon stick

      Bring sugar and red wine to boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add cranberries, orange rind, and cinnamon stick.  Return to a boil, stirring constantly.  Reduce heat, and simmer, partially covered, about 15-20 minutes or until cranberry skins pop.  Remove and discard cinnamon stick.  Cool slightly; serve warm, or chill for 2 hours, if desired.
