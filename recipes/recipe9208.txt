GARLIC BEEF ENCHILADAS


1  lb. ground beef, cooked, drained and crumbled
1  medium onion, chopped
2  Tbsp. all-purpose flour
1/2  Tbsp. chili powder
1/2  tsp. salt
1  tsp. garlic powder
1/2  tsp. ground cumin, optional
1 (14.5 oz.)  can stewed tomatoes
1  can enchilada sauce
10  flour tortillas
2  c. shredded Co Jack or Mexican melting cheese

      In saucepan over medium heat, combine beef, onions and about 1/2 cup water; cook until onions are translucent.  Add flour and seasonings; mix well.  Stir in tomatoes; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat; simmer about 15 minutes, until most of liquid is absorbed. Pour about 1 1/2 cups sauce into an ungreased 9 x 13 inch baking dish.  Spread about 1/4 cup beef mixture down the center of each tortilla shell; top with 1 to 2 Tbsp. cheese.  Roll up tightly; place seam side down over sauce.  Repeat with each tortilla shell. Top with remaining sauce and cheese.  Broil on LOW until cheese is melted and bubbly.  Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
