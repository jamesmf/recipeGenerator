HOMEMADE VEGETABLE BROTH


4  tomatoes, coarsely chopped
1  med. onion, quartered
2 large  cloves of garlic, halved
2  ribs of celery with tops, coarsely chopped
2  carrots, cut into 1/2 inch slices
4  large chard leaves, chopped, washed and drained
2  summer squash, cut into 1 inch chunks
12  pea pods
1  cup fresh flat leaf parsley
1/2  cup cilantro
2  sprigs fresh thyme or 1/4 tsp dried
1  bay leaf
2  tsp salt
10  cups of water

      Combine all ingredients in a pressure cooker.  Lock on lid and bring to pressure over high heat, about 18 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium and cook for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 15 minutes to finish cooking.
       Release steam vent on pressure cooker.  Drain broth through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl.  Discard solids.  Can be stored in refrigerator 1 week.  May be frozen for up to 6 months.
      NOTES:  Cooking vegetables too long will make murky broth. Broth can be cooked in regular pot.  That tends to be an all day affair.
