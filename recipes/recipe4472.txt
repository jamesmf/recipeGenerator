HAM AND BEAN SOUP OR HAM AND POTATO SOUP


3/4 to 1  lb. Cook's ham slice
2  cans Swanson vegetable broth
1  can chicken broth
3  stalks celery
3  carrots
1  medium onion
1/4  tsp. fresh ground pepper
3  cans navy beans (not drained) or 3 to 4 potatoes, cubed (with or without skins)
1  stick butter (be sure to use real butter)
1/2  c. flour
3  c. milk (skim works, whole is richer or anything in between)
1/8  tsp. fresh ground pepper

      In large soup pot, add ham, cubed into 1/4 to 3/8-inch cubes, pepper, broth, celery, carrots, onion and beans (cubed potatoes if you are making potato soup), all cut into soup size chunks. Bring to a boil, then turn down to simmer while you thicken milk.
      In smaller but heavy pot, melt butter with pepper over medium+ heat. Add flour while whisking. It will get pasty. Slowly add milk while stirring with the whisk constantly. Keep stirring until it boils or just before; the mixture will be quite thick. Be careful not to scorch the milk. By now the vegetables should be cooked. Combine; stir and enjoy.
      Remember to scrape the gooey stuff from the milk pot with a spatula; that's the best part.  Start to finish, this recipe should only take 25 to 30 minutes.
