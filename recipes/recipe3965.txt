ROASTED SOUTHERN PECANS
(Sweet and Piquant)  

1  large egg white (2 Tbsp.)
1/2  c. sugar
2  Tbsp. sweet paprika
2  tsp. worcestershire sauce
1 to 2  tsp. cayenne pepper, to taste
1/2  tsp. kosher salt
2  c. raw pecan halves

      Preheat oven to 250 degrees;.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Place the egg white in a large stainless steel bowl and whisk until frothy.  Whisk in the sugar, paprika, worcestershire, cayenne and salt.  Add the pecans and toss until completely coated.  Transfer pecans to prepared sheet and arrange in a single layer.  Place in the oven and cook, stirring every 15 minutes, until lightly colored and dried out, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, immediately loosen the nuts with a metal spatula and set aside to cool before serving.  Makes 2 cups.
