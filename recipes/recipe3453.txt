CHEESE RING


1  lb. sharp Cheddar
1  lb. Colby or medium Cheddar
1  medium onion
1  c. mayo (approximately)
1  c. pecan pieces
  black or red pepper to taste
  crackers (Club or Town House)

      Grate cheeses and onion (do not use pre-grated cheese as it's too dry). Use paper towel to oil ring completely. Sprinkle in pecan pieces. Mix cheese, onion and mayo together well. Add pepper and mix. Put into ring and chill 24 hours.
      May use "light" mayo, not Miracle Whip.
      May freeze up to 1 month.
      Can serve with strawberry preserves along with the crackers.
