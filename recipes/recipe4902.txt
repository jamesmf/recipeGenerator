SHRIMP-CRAB GUMBO

Roux:
1 1/2  c. vegetable oil
2  c. all-purpose flour

      In a large heavy Dutch oven or cast iron skillet over medium heat stir together the flour and oil, and cook, whisking constantly, until flour is a rich copper color (about 20 minutes--don't leave it or stop whisking for a second!).  Remove from heat immediately so it won't burn and proceed with gumbo recipe below.
