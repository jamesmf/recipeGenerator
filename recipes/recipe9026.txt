CHARCOALED MARINATED CHICKEN BREASTS


6  small chicken breasts, boned or 3 large, each cut in half
3  medium garlic cloves, crushed
1 1/2  tsp. salt (I eliminate)
1/2  c. brown sugar (can use brown sugar substitute)
3  Tbsp. grainy mustard
1/4  c. cider vinegar
  juice of 1 lime
  juice of 1/2 large lemon
6  Tbsp. olive oil (substitute apple juice for oil)
  black pepper to taste

      Put chicken breasts in skillet bowl. Mix garlic, salt, sugar, mustard, vinegar, lime and lemon juices. Blend well. Whisk in the oil (apple juice) and add pepper. Pour over chicken and refrigerate overnight.
      Remove from fridge 1 hour before cooking. Grill breasts 4 minutes per side or until done. Do not overcook as they will toughen. You can cook under broiler too!
