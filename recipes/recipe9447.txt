CROCK-POT BARBECUE


  pork roast
1  c. sugar
1  c. vinegar
  salt and pepper
  red crushed pepper
  hot or barbecue sauce

	Cook pork roast in crock-pot. Take out. Cut up pork taking fat out. Drain juice. Put pork back in empty crock-pot. Add sugar, vinegar, salt, pepper and red crushed pepper to taste. Also add hot sauce or barbecue sauce. Pour about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of juice back over pork. Cook on low about 6 to 8 hours. The longer it cooks without drying out, the better it is.
