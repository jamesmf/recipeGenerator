GRILLED CHICKEN SALAD


4  small skinless boneless chicken breast halves (about 12 oz. total)
1/4  c. frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed
2  tsp. finely shredded lemon peel
2  Tbsp. lemon juice
2  tsp. olive oil
2  cloves garlic, minced
1/2  c. fat-free mayonnaise dressing or salad dressing
2  Tbsp. milk
1  Tbsp. frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed
1  Tbsp. coarse-grain brown mustard
6  c. torn mixed greens
2  medium apples, cored and thinly sliced
1  Tbsp. broken walnuts, toasted (optional)

      Rinse chicken; pat dry with paper towels.  Place in a plastic bag set in a shallow dish.  For marinade, stir together the 1/4 cup orange juice concentrate, the lemon peel, lemon juice, oil and garlic.  Pour over chicken.  Close bag.  Marinate in the refrigerator for 6 to 24 hours; turn bag occasionally.
      For dressing, in a bowl, stir together mayonnaise dressing, milk, the  1 tablespoon orange juice concentrate, the mustard and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cover; refrigerate until serving time. Drain chicken, discarding marinade. Grill chicken on the rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium coals for 12 to 15 minutes or until chicken is tender and no longer pink, turning once. Arrange mixed greens and apple slices on 4 plates.
       To serve, cut chicken breast halves into slices. Arrange slices on top of greens; drizzle with dressing. If desired, sprinkle with walnuts. Serves 4.
