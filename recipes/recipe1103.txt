STUFFED PORK CHOPS


8  lean pork chops, very thinly sliced and flattened into cutlets (1 lb.)
1  chopped onion
2  Tbsp. chopped celery
2  Tbsp. chopped parsley
8  tsp. butter
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. poultry seasoning
  pepper to taste
2  c. fresh bread crumbs
1/2  c. chicken bouillon, defatted
2  Tbsp. flour

      Lightly pound the cutlets to make them into thin fillets.  Melt half the butter and saut√© the onion, parsley, and celery over gentle heat.  Add the seasonings.  Remove from the heat and place in a bowl.  Add the bread crumbs, dampened with a bit of water and mix gently.  Divide into 8 equal portions and place each on a pork fillet.  Roll and secure with a skewer or tie with string.  Dredge in flour sprinkled on waxed paper.  Brown in a frying pan, using the rest of the butter.  Add the chicken stock, lower the heat, cover and cook very slowly, about 1 1/2 hours.
      Exchange value:  2 chops equal 3 meat exchanges plus 1 bread exchange plus 2 fat exchanges.
