FANCY MEAT LOAF WITH TOMATO RELISH

Tomato Relish:
2  Tbsp. olive oil
2  garlic cloves
2  bay leaves
1  small onion, diced
2  red peppers, seeded and chopped
1/4  c. chopped parsley
1  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
12  oz. bottled ketchup

 
Meat Loaf:
1 1/2  lb. ground beef
1  lb. ground pork
3  eggs
2  Tbsp. fresh thyme leaves
  salt and pepper to taste

      For Tomato Relish, coat skillet with olive oil and place over medium heat.  Saut√© the garlic, bay leaves and onion until they caramelize.  Add red peppers and cook until soft.  Add the tomatoes, parsley and Worcestershire sauce.  Cook for 10 minutes until vegetables cook down.  Stir in ketchup and continue to cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.
      In large mixing bowl, combine ground beef and pork together with hands.  Fold in 1/2 cup of Tomato Relish.  Add the eggs and thyme and mix with hands until blended.  Do not overmix or meat loaf will become dense and tough.  Season with salt and pepper. Coat a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray.  Fill loaf pan with meat mixture, mounding it a bit on top.  Generously spoon some Tomato Relish on the surface.  When cooked, this will form a crust. Place loaf pan on cookie sheet and bake in a preheated 350 degrees; oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until meat loaf pulls away from pan. Remove from pan.  Allow to cool slightly before cutting into slices.  Yields 6 to 8 servings.  Prep time:  20 minutes.  Cook time:  2 hours.
