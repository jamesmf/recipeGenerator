WHOLE WHEAT PIZZA

Crusts:
2 to 2 1/2  c. all-purpose flour
1  c. whole-wheat flour
1  tsp. salt
1  pkg. quick-rising yeast
1  c. hot water (125~ to 130~)
2  Tbsp. vegetable oil
  cornmeal

 
Pizza Sauce:
1 (8 oz.)  can no-salt-added tomato sauce
3  oz. tomato paste (half 6 oz. can)
1  tsp. sugar
1  tsp. oregano leaves
1  clove garlic, minced

 
Pizza Topping:
8  oz. part-skim Mozzarella cheese, shredded (2 c.)
4  Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese
  chopped green pepper, mushrooms and onions (optional)

      Set aside 1 cup all-purpose flour. In a large bowl, combine remaining all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, salt and yeast. Stir hot water and oil into dry ingredients. Mix in only enough of reserved flour to make a soft, but not sticky, dough. Turn out onto lightly floured board; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover; let rest 10 minutes.
      Punch dough down; divide in half. Using a rolling pin, roll and stretch each half to a 13-inch circle. Place on two 12-inch round pizza pans or 2 baking sheets that have been oiled and sprinkled with cornmeal. Shape edges into a standing rim of dough. Bake crusts in preheated 450 degrees; oven for 8 minutes.
       While dough is cooking, combine pizza sauce ingredients. Spread each crust with half the pizza sauce and half the Mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle each pizza with 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese. Bake 10 to 12 minutes more or until cheese melts and is lightly browned. Cut into wedges to serve. Makes 6 servings at 1/3 pizza each.
Tips:

      Water at 125 degrees; is very hot to the touch. A quick registering thermometer is a nice kitchen tool to have to check the temperature.
      Baked slices of pizza freeze well.
      Serve with fresh fruit salad.
