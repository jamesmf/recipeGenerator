GOLDEN ONION RINGS


6  medium bernids or white onions
1  c. plus 2 Tbsp. flour (self-rising or all-purpose)
1/2  tsp. salt
1  slightly beaten egg
1  c. milk
2  Tbsp. salad oil

      Cut onions into 1/4-inch thick slices; separate into rings. Beat together rest of ingredients until flour is well moistened, then coat onion rings with batter.  Fry a few at a time in deep hot fat or oil at 375 degrees;, stirring once to separate rings.  When onions are golden, drain on paper towel.  Just before serving, sprinkle with salt.
