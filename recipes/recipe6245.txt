MANHATTAN CLAM CHOWDER


3 to 4  slices bacon or 2 Tbsp. cooking oil
1  large onion, coarsely chopped
3  medium potatoes, cubed
1  c. sliced celery
2  carrots, sliced
1  c. diced green pepper
1 (15 oz.)  can stewed tomatoes, cut into small chunks
1  lb. fresh, chopped clams or 3 (6 oz.) cans chopped clams*
6  c. boiling water (part chicken broth)
2 to 3  cloves garlic, minced
1  tsp. chili powder
  salt and dried thyme (more or less to taste)
  chopped parsley (optional)

      *Note:  If you use canned clams, add these with liquid during last 5 minutes of soup making.
      Fry bacon until crisp.  Remove, drain on paper towels, crumble and reserve.  Discard all but 2 tablespoons of fat.  Add onions, potatoes and carrots and saut√© about 2 minutes.  Add tomatoes, boiling liquids, fresh clams with their liquid, celery and garlic. Bring to gentle simmer and cook, covered, for 20 minutes.  Add peppers and all seasonings.  Simmer an additional 15 minutes.
       If chowder is thicker than you like at this point, add some more hot liquid.  Taste and adjust seasonings.  Thicken simmering soup with 1 tablespoon cornstarch, diluted in 1/4 cup cold water. Simmer 5 minutes longer.  Add chopped parsley and serve with crusty bread.
      Note:  Flavor improves if chowder is made day before serving.
