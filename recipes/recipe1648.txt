KESAKEITTO
(Summer Soup)  

5  medium-large potatoes, peeled and cut in bite-size pieces
5  carrots, peeled and sliced
1 3/4  c. cauliflower (fresh or frozen), thawed
2  Tbsp. melted butter
2  c. milk
  chopped dill or parsley
1  c. plus frozen (thawed) or fresh peas
1  c. plus frozen (thawed) or fresh green beans
1  egg yolk
4  Tbsp. flour
  salt and pepper to taste

      In a large kettle, bring water and the potatoes to a boil.  Add the carrots and bring to a boil.  Cook a few minutes.  Add the peas, beans and cauliflower and cook until nearly tender.  Pour into a colander.  Save the broth and vegetables.  Mix the egg yolk, melted butter and flour to a paste.  Add to the milk and stir. Return the broth to the kettle and add the flour mixture slowly, as the broth heats, to thicken the broth.  (If it doesn't thicken enough, prepare and add more of the egg, butter and flour mixture.) Return the vegetables to the broth and heat gently.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Before serving, sprinkle with chopped parsley or dill.
