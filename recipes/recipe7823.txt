1/2  c. Kraft Light Mayonnaise
1  Tbsp. lemon juice
1  tsp. dill weed
1/2  tsp. grated lemon peel
1  lb. firm-textured fish filets (such as cod, catfish or salmon)

      Mix mayonnaise, lemon juice, dill and lemon peel.  Place fish on greased grill over medium coals.  Brush with 1/2 of the mayonnaise mixture.  Grill 5 minutes, turn.  Brush with remaining mayonnaise mixture.  Grill an additional 5 to 8 minutes or until fish flakes easily with fork.
