ORANGE SURPRISE SALAD


3  oz. orange Jell-O
8  oz. sour cream
1 small  can crushed pineapple, drained
1 small  can mandarin oranges
1  (8 oz.) Cool Whip
2  c. miniature marshmallows

	Dissolve Jell-O in sour cream.	Add drained fruit and marshmallows.  Fold in Cool Whip.  Chill overnight.
	Note:  Pineapple tidbits are equally good in this salad.  I call it Orange Surprise because it is surprising simple and surprisingly good!
