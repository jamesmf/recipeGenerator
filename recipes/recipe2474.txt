WASSAIL


1  gal. canned apple juice
2  c. pineapple juice
2  c. orange juice
  juice of 2 lemons
2  sticks cinnamon
6  to 8 whole cloves
1  c. sugar

      Simmer all ingredients for 20 minutes.  Remove spices and serve hot.  I usually halve this recipe and it fits in the crock-pot. This is great to make for the holidays and the aroma is wonderful!
