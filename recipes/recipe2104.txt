GUMDROPS


1 (1 3/4 oz.)  pkg. powdered fruit pectin
3/4  c. water
1/2  tsp. baking soda
1  c. sugar
1  c. light corn syrup
2  tsp. imitation strawberry extract
  red food coloring
  sugar

      Combine fruit pectin, water and baking soda in medium size saucepan.  (This mixture will foam.)  Combine sugar and corn syrup in large saucepan.  Place both pans over high heat.  Cook, stirring alternately, until the foam disappears from the fruit pectin mixture and the sugar mixture boils rapidly, about 5 minutes.  Pour fruit pectin mixture into the sugar mixture in a thin stream until all pectin is added.  Boil mixture, stirring constantly, 1 minute longer.  Remove from heat, stir in strawberry extract and few drops red food coloring.  Immediately pour mixture into an 8 x 8 x 2-inch pan.
      For fancy shapes, spoon mix into tart or hors d'oeuvres pans. Cool at room temperature 3 hours until candy is cool and firm.  Cut into squares and roll in sugar.
