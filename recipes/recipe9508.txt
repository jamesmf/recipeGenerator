EYE OF ROUND


2 1/2 to 3  lb. eye of round roast
  seasoned salt
  lemon-pepper seasoning
1/2  c. soy sauce (low salt is fine)
1/2  c. commercial Italian salad dressing
1/4  c. Worcestershire sauce
  dash of Tabasco sauce

      Dry roast with paper towel.  Pierce roast in several places across top and bottom.  Sprinkle seasoned salt and lemon pepper over surface and rub in.  Combine remaining ingredients.  Stir well.  Pour over roast.  Cover and marinate in refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.  Turn once or twice.  I use large freezer bag for roast and marinade.  Easy to turn and can be thrown away.
      Remove roast from marinade.  Discard marinade.  Place roast in shallow baking pan.  Insert meat thermometer and roast at 325 degrees; until thermometer registers your desired degree of doneness.
