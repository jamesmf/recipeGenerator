      Cook chicken until tender. Remove from bone and cut into bit size pieces. Save broth. Dice celery and onion, add to broth and cook until tender. Add spaghetti to broth and cook until tender. Drain, but save broth.
       In a separate pan mix and stir constantly until thickened, margarine, flour and milk. Add one at a time, American cream cheese, Cheddar cheese and mushroom soup. Stir into chicken and spaghetti. Add enough broth so it won't be dry. Pour into 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Top with cracker crumbs, add paprika for color. Bake at 350 degrees; for 35 minutes. If it seems too soupy, bake a few minutes longer.
      Canned Chicken and  Chicken broth may be used in place of the fresh, whole chicken.
