BEEF RAGOUT


2  lb. sirloin steak (bite size pieces)
1  large onion, chopped
1  can beef bouillon
1  c. non-alcoholic cooking sherry
1  bay leaf
2  Tbsp. grated lemon rind
  salt and pepper to taste
1/4  c. cornstarch
3  Tbsp. water

      Put all ingredients, except cornstarch and water, into slow cooker (crock-pot) for six hours or so.  (I cook mine during work hours.)  Bring to a boil just before serving.  Mix cornstarch and water and add to meat mixture.  Boil until thickened.  Delicious served over rice or noodles.
