POKE SALLET


  poke greens

      Pick greens while they are still young and tender if possible. Greens will be sweeter if they have been frosted on!  Pick what looks like twice as much as you think you need, because they shrink up.  Wash the greens at least 4 or 5 times to remove all dirt. Remove any hard stems.
      Cut leaves or break them up with your hands.  Place greens into a large pot, cover and cook over medium high heat.  I add about half a cup of water.  When they have cooked until they are soft, add a few tablespoons of bacon drippings.  Mama used a slab of salt pork or a ham bone to season greens.
      Let greens simmer until done.  Add water as needed, if liquid gets low.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  The juice is called "pot likker" and it is good to eat poured over bread.  Let the pot likker cook until it is rich.  You will have about a quart of greens and a pint of liquid from a grocery sack full of greens.  A lot of people like to pour vinegar from pickled peppers over their greens.  Most everybody has to have cornbread with them, too.
      We sometimes added turnips, peeled and cubed, to the greens. But, a lot of people like them cooked separately.  Collard greens have larger leaves and have a stronger taste.  You can use dandelion greens, watercress, mustard greens, etc.
