QUICHE LORRAINE


  Pastry for 9 inch one crust pie (I use Pillsbury ready made crust)
12  slices bacon (about 1/2 lb) crisply fried and crumbled
1  cup shredded natural Swiss or Cheddar Cheese
1/3  cup minced onions
4  eggs
2  cups whipping cream
3/4  tsp salt
1/4  tsp sugar
1/8  tsp cayenne pepper

      Heat oven to 425 degrees.  Prepare pastry.  Sprinkle bacon, cheese and onion in pastry lined pie pan.  Beat eggs slightly, beat in the remaining ingredients.  Pour cream mixture into pie pan. Bake 15 minutes.
      Reduce temperature to 300 degrees and bake 30 minutes longer or until a knife inserted 1 inch from the edge comes out clean. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.  Serve in wedges.  Makes 6 main dish servings or can be cut into smaller wedges for an appetizer.
      For other variations in place of the bacon you can use:
      10 oz pkg of broccoli (I partially cook it).
      10 oz pkg of spinach (thawed and well squeezed out).
      10 oz pkg of asparagus (partially cooked).
