BURMESE RED CURRY
(A Simple Yet Popular Burmese Dish, Known as See-Piyan)  

1  lb. boneless chicken breast or boneless beef cubes
2  medium-sized onions, pureed
1  tsp. each, garlic and ginger paste
1  tsp. salt
1  tsp. cayenne pepper
1/2  tsp. turmeric
1/4  tsp. monosodium glutamate
2  Tbsp. tomato paste
1/2  Tbsp. lemon juice
1/2  cup cooking oil
1/2  cup water

      Combine chicken or beef with all ingredients, except water. Cook covered over medium heat for 10 minutes.  Remove lid and braise meat over medium-low heat, with a wooden spoon for another 10 minutes.  The key is to braise the meat very well.
       When meat is very fragrant, add water; cover again and cook over very low heat until meat is cooked and oil separates.   Serve with plain boiled rice or coconut rice.
