CHOLYA SAALAN


1/2  tsp. mustard seeds
1/2  cup cooking oil
  4-6 curry leaves
3  green chilies
1  medium onion, finely grated
1  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. turmeric
1-1/4  tsp. garlic paste
1-1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper
1  tsp. cumin powder
1  tsp. coriander powder
1/2  tomato, thinly sliced
5  Tbsp. tamarind  paste (imly)
1/2  pound catfish pieces

      Clean, wash, and dry the catfish; sprinkle with salt and set aside.
      Put the mustard seeds and oil in a pot.  Cover and turn heat to low.  When seeds start sputtering, put in green chilies (make a little slit in the center of each chili) and curry leaves. Cover again and when the sputtering sounds slow down, add the grated onion, salt, turmeric, garlic paste, cayenne, cumin powder, and coriander powder, braising between each spice.  Braise well, adding few drops of water as necessary to keep from scorching.
      Now add tomato slices and fish and  braise another 2 minutes, turning fish pieces once.  Add the tamarind along with 1/2 cup of water and cover the pot.  Cook over low heat until catfish is cooked thoroughly and oil separates from the gravy.
      Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve hot with rice.
