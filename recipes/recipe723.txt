1 1/2  lb. veal steak, 1/2-inch thick
  flour, seasoned with salt and pepper
1  c. water (or more if needed)
8  oz. wide noodles
5  Tbsp. butter, divided
1/2  c. slivered almonds
2  Tbsp. poppy seed
1  c. cream
  paprika

      Cut steak into 4 portions and roll in the seasoned flour.  In heavy skillet, heat some oil and brown meat on both sides.  Add water and cover; simmer on low heat until tender, adding a little more water if necessary to prevent sticking.
      Cook and drain noodles.  Set aside.  Melt 1 tablespoon butter in skillet; stir in almonds, saut√© until only lightly browned.  Add the remaining butter and drained noodles.  Stir in poppy seed; mix well and heat only until the noodles are reheated.  Stir 1 cup cream into pan drippings and heat.  Sprinkle with paprika.
