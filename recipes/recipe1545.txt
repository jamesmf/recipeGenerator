CREAM SHERBET PUNCH


1  qt. orange sherbet
1  qt. vanilla ice cream
2 large  cans pineapple juice or frozen orange juice
1  qt. ginger ale or 7-Up

      In 6 to 6 1/2-cup ring mold, arrange thin citrus slices and maraschino cherries or strawberries in an attractive design.  Pour water into mold to partially cover fruit.  Freeze.
      When frozen, add water to fill mold 3/4 full; freeze.  At serving time, unmold and float fruit side up in punch bowl.
      If you prefer, freeze ring without decoration.  Or, instead of freezing water, freeze part of a non-sparkling punch itself; this will keep punch cold without diluting it.
