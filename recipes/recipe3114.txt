BACON CHEDDAR EGGS


12  eggs, boiled and peeled
1/2  c. mayonnaise
4  strips bacon, fried and crumbled
2  Tbsp. shredded Cheddar cheese
1  Tbsp. honey mustard
1/4  tsp. black pepper

      Slice boiled eggs lengthways; remove yolk and set whites aside. In a bowl, mix egg yolks, mayonnaise, bacon, cheese, honey mustard and black pepper. Spoon (or pipe) yolk mixture into the hollow egg whites.
      Tip: You may substitute 1 1/2 tsp. Dijon mustard mixed with 1 1/2 tsp. honey for the 1 Tbsp. honey mustard.
