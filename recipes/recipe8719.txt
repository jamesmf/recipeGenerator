KIBBEE


2  lb. rd. steak with all fat trimmed off
  5-6 sprigs mint
1 1/2  c. burghul (#1 cracked wheat)
1  sprig basil
1  med. onion
1/2  tsp. pepper
1  med. red pepper
1/2  tsp. cumin
1/4- 1/2  c. ice water

      After trimming all the fat from steak, cut into pieces to fit into grinder.  Grind twice.  Soak burghul 5 mins in enough water to cover after it was washed once or twice.  Grind pepper, onion, mint and basil and add to meat.  Add salt, spices and burghul. Burghul should be squeezed to remove all water before adding to meat.  Mix meat mixture by hand till well blended.  Add ice water as you mix to keep meat soft.  Consistency should not be too dry, more like a moist meat loaf mixture before cooking.  Arrange in flat dish, garnish with parsley or mint sprigs.  Serve with oil and pita bread.  Leftover kibbee may be cooked the next day.
