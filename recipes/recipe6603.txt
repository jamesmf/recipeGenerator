EASY HERBED GRILLED SALMON



1/2  lb. salmon filet
1  Tbsp. butter or margarine
1/2  lemon
2  Tbsp. white wine
1/2  tsp. salt (optional)
1/2  tsp. onion powder
1/2  tsp. garlic powder
1/2  tsp. lemon pepper
1  tsp. oregano
1/2  tsp. dill weed
1/2  tsp. parsley flakes
1/4  tsp. paprika

      Preheat grill. Make a tray out of heavy-duty foil by folding a long piece in half and folding up all 4 sides with the dull side up. Spray the bottom of the foil tray with cooking spray. Place fish filet in the tray, skin side down. Smear a thin line of butter on filet. Squeeze lemon juice liberally over filet and then a splash of white wine. Sprinkle remaining seasonings lightly over filet and transfer the foil tray to the hot grill. Cover. Cook for 10 minutes per inch of thickness of filet. DO NOT overcook or it will be dry and unpalatable. Turning is not necessary. Salmon is done when it turns a light pink color throughout.
