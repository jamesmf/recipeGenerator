Meat:
2  lbs. chicken, veal, or lamb
1-1/2  tsp. each, garlic and ginger paste (bit less for chicken)
2  tsp. (or more) cayenne pepper
1-1/2  tsp. paprika
2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. whole cumin
1/2  tsp. cloves
2  broken cinnamon sticks
  8-10 whole black peppercorns
4  whole cardamoms
  4-5 whole bay leaves

      Marinate the meat in all the ingredients for 1 hour. Transfer meat to a pot. Add 1/2 cup water (or more, depending on type of meat.)  Cover and boil over low heat until meat is tender and most of the water has evaporated.  Take off heat and set aside.
Gravy:
2  medium onions, grated
3/4  cup oil
1 (8 oz.)  can tomato sauce OR 1 (6 oz.) can tomato paste
1  tsp. cumin powder
  Pinch salt
1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper
  Pinch turmeric
  4-5 strands saffron, crushed
  4-5 whole green chilies
1/4  cup green peas (optional)
  4-5 tiny, white pearl onions

      Heat oil and fry onions until well browned.  At this point, remove excess oil if necessary.  Add tomato paste or sauce to the browned onions and mix well.  If using tomato paste, keep adding a little water to prevent the texture from becoming too thick.  Stir in the cumin powder, salt, cayenne, turmeric and saffron.  Over low heat, braise very well, until aroma arises and oil separates.
      Add the boiled meat and keep braising until well combined. Now add the green chilies, peas, and pearl onions.  Braise until everything is well coated.  Pour 1/8 cup of water into the pot, stirring well.  Cover and cook over very low heat until oil separates and gravy evens out.
      Serve with hot rice or pita bread.
