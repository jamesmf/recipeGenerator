HARD CLAY


2  c. flour
1/2  c. salt
3/4  c. water

      Mix ingredients together in a big bowl.  Form into a big lump. Roll dough between 2 pieces of wax paper or plastic wrap with a rolling pin.  Use cookie cutters to cut out the shapes.  Punch a hole through each shape.  Let shapes dry for 1 week or dry them in a warm oven.  Paint and tie loops of yarn or string through holes.
      Note:  This clay hardens so you can keep the items you make.
