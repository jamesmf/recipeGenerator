SOUTHWEST SOUP


1  large onion, chopped
2  lb. ground meat
3 (No. 303)  cans Ranch Style beans
2  cans minestrone soup
1  can beef broth or 2 c. water and 2 bouillon cubes
1  can Ro-Tel tomatoes

      Saut√© onions; brown meat and drain. Add all the other ingredients. Season to taste with salt, pepper and garlic. Simmer for 45 minutes.
      I usually put this in a crock-pot when I get up and it is ready when I come in. You may add mixed vegetables (Veg-All) and some pasta, noodles, macaroni, etc. Serve with grated cheese and corn bread. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
