CHICKEN BROTH


6  lb. hen or two 3 lb. fryers or chicken pieces
2  ribs of celery, washed and cut in strips
2  whole carrots, washed and cut in strips

      Wash and cut hen into frying pieces.  Salt and pepper chicken.  Place in large saucepan and cover with water.  Cook on stovetop until meat is done, about 1 hour (45 minutes in pressure cooker).  Remove chicken from pot, discard celery and carrots; strain broth.  Reserve chicken for other uses.
       Yield:  4 to 6 cups broth.  Add water to make 6 cups if desired, especially if broth produces a lot of fat, which will float to the top when cool.
