BAKED ZITI WITH PESTO


1 1/2  lb. ziti pasta
2  Tbsp. cooking oil
1  onion, chopped
2  cloves garlic, minced
2  c. canned crushed tomatoes (in thick puree)
1/4  tsp. salt
1  bay leaf
1/2  tsp. black pepper
1  c. Ricotta cheese
1 1/2  c. grated, packaged Mozzarella cheese
1/2  c. grated Parmesan cheese
1/4  c. store bought or homemade pesto

      Heat oven to 350 degrees;. Oil an 8 x 8-inch baking dish. In large pot of boiling, salted water, cook pasta for 7 minutes. It will be partially cooked. Drain and rinse with cold water.
      In medium saucepan, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil over low heat. Cook the onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, salt and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer and cook until very thick, about 10 minutes. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Remove bay leaf.
      In small bowl, combine Ricotta, 1 cup of the Mozzarella, half the Parmesan, the pesto and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Put half of the cooked pasta into the baking dish and top with 1/3 of the tomato sauce. Spread the Ricotta mixture on the sauce in an even layer. Cover with the remaining pasta and then remaining sauce. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup of Mozzarella and remaining Parmesan. Drizzle with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil. Bake until bubbling, about 30 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes before cutting.
