CORNBREAD DRESSING


1  large pan homemade cornbread
1  lb. Jimmy Dean (sage) sausage
1  medium onion, chopped well
6  stalks celery, chopped well
1  can creamy onion soup
1  can cream of celery soup
2  cans chicken broth
1/2  stick melted butter

	In a very large bowl, crumble cornbread very well. Add remaining ingredients, mixing well. Spray Pam or Wesson oil on the inside of pan. Be careful; will burn easy! Bake at 350 degrees; for 45 minutes or until brown and not soupy.
