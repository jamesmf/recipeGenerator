SALMON AND ORANGES


2  lb. of a thick slice of salmon
3  to 4 oranges, peeled and sliced
2  tsp. grated nutmeg
1  c. good red wine
1  c. orange juice

      Remove the skin from the salmon.  In the bottom of a pan, place enough orange slices to have under the salmon.  Lay the salmon on top and sprinkle it with the nutmeg.  Place the remaining slices of orange over the salmon.  Pour on the wine and orange juice and bring to a boil.  Cover and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the salmon is cooked.  Remove the salmon from the pan and place on serving dish.
      This is something I often cook.  It's quick, easy, very tasty and looks impressive.
