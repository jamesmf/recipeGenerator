CHEESEBURGER PIE


3 to 4  lb. hamburger meat
1  large onion, chopped
4  pkg. of crescent rolls, uncooked
1 large  box of Velveeta cheese

      Fry hamburger meat until done.  Drain off excess fat.  Add onions to the meat and cook until onions turn clear.  Set meat mixture aside.  When you open the crescent rolls, do not separate into crescent shapes but leave as rectangles.  Line the bottom of a lightly greased 9 x 13-inch baking pan with a layer of crescent rolls.  Add the hamburger and onion mix.  Top with a layer of the Velveeta cheese and finish with another layer of crescent rolls until all the top is covered.  Put in 375 degrees; oven and bake until crescent rolls turn golden brown. Cut into cubes to suit your plate.  Great served with salad and baked beans.
