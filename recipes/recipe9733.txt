ORIENTAL CATFISH


1  lb. catfish fillets
2  Tbsp. light soy sauce
1/2  tsp. grated fresh ginger
1/4  tsp. red pepper flakes
3  Tbsp. white wine or sherry
1  Tbsp. sliced green onions

      Make a marinade by mixing soy sauce, ginger, red pepper flakes and wine together. Marinate catfish for about 1 hour in the refrigerator. Broil the catfish for approximately 5 to 7 minutes until the flesh starts to flake easily. Baste often with marinade.
