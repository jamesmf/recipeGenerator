BAKED ONIONS IN THEIR SKINS


4  medium to large yellow or sweet Bermuda onions
1 1/2  Tbsp. unsalted butter or margarine, diced
  salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
  parsley sprigs (for garnish)

      Preheat oven to 375 degrees;.  Line a small baking pan with aluminum foil and spray with vegetable cooking spray.  Trim off the root ends of the onions but leave the skin intact.

Season with salt and pepper and serve piping hot, garnished with parsley sprigs.  Serves 4.
