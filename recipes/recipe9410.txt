SPAGHETTI PIE


4  oz. spaghetti
2  slightly beaten egg whites
1/3  c. grated parmesan cheese
1  Tbsp. margarine
  non-stick spray coating
2  slightly beaten egg whites
1  c. lower-fat cottage cheese, drained
8  oz. 90% lean ground beef
1/2  c. chopped onion
1/4  c. chopped green pepper
1 8  oz. can lower-sodium tomato sauce
1  tsp. dried Italian seasoning, crushed
1/4  tsp. salt
1/2  c. shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese, 2 oz.

      For crust, cook spaghetti according to the package directions, except omit the cooking oil and salt.  Drain well. Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl stir together the 2 egg whites, the parmesan cheese, and margarine.  Stir into the hot cooked spaghetti.  Spray a 9 inch pie plate with nonstick coating. Arrange spaghetti mixture evenly in the bottom and up the sides of the pie plate.  In another bowl, stir together the remaining 2 egg whites and the drained cottage cheese.  Spread cottage cheese mixture over the crust.  Set aside.  In a large skillet cook the meat, onion, and green pepper till meat is brown.  Drain off fat. Stir in the tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, and salt.  Heat through.  Spoon over cottage cheese mixture in crust.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes.  Sprinkle with the mozzarella cheese.  Bake about 5 minutes more or till the cheese melts and the crust is set.  Let stand 5 minutes.  Cut into wedges.  Makes 5 servings.
