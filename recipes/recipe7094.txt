CHICKEN ENCHILADAS

Enchiladas:
1  pkg. corn tortillas
1 large  can enchilada sauce
1  pkg. longhorn grated cheddar cheese
4  chicken breasts, boiled and diced
1  large onion
1  can cream of mushroom soup
1/2 small  can chopped green chillies and onion
  salt and garlic pepper

      Combine chicken, 1/2 of the cheese, onions, soup, seasonings, and chillies in large bowl.  Heat enchilada sauce in medium saucepan.  Dip the tortillas in the sauce long enough for them to become soft, just a few seconds.  Fill tortilla as you would a crepe and roll.  Place in flat baking dish or casserole.  Top with remaining cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 20 minutes.
Sauce:
1  carton sour cream
2  Tbsp. butter
  milk

      Combine sour cream with butter and enough milk to thin to gravy consistency. Heat, but do not boil.  Serve over enchiladas.
