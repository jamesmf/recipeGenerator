COCONUT RICE


2  c. rice
  coconut
4  c. water
1  c. raisins
1  c. brown sugar
1  tsp. salt

      Blend the coconut with its own milk and drain the liquid into a pan.  Boil coconut milk to get the coconut oil.  Reserve oil.  Add the milk to the coconut and drain again.  Put this milk in the pan with the coconut oil.  Add rice, brown sugar, salt and raisins. Bring to a boil.  Cover and reduce heat to very low.  Simmer for about 20 minutes or until the liquid has been absorbed.
