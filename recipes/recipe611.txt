GRILLED VEAL CHOPS



4  veal chops, cut 1-inch thick and well trimmed
  salt and freshly ground pepper
1 1/2  Tbsp. olive oil
1  tsp. crumbled Herbes de Provence*

      Preheat an outdoor grill or a broiler.  Place the veal chops in a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper.  Combine the oil with Herbes de Provence and brush lightly over both sides of the chops.  Allow to sit for 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature. Grill the chops for 5 to 6 minutes per side or until the desired degree of doneness.  Serve hot, garnished with parsley or other fresh herbs.  Serves 4.
      *This is a French blend of herbs available in gourmet food shops and some supermarkets.  If you can't find it, substitute a blend of 1 tablespoon each crumbled dried basil, oregano and thyme and 1/2 teaspoon each crumbled dried sage and ground rosemary; a pinch of dried lavender is optional.
