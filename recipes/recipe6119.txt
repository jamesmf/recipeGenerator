BAKED POTATO SOUP


4  large potatoes
2/3  c. butter
2/3  c. flour
1 1/2  qt. milk, 6 cups
4  green onions, chopped
1  c. sour cream
2  c. crumbled bacon, cooked crisp
5  oz. cheddar cheese, grated
  salt and pepper, to taste

      Heat oven to 350 degrees and bake potatoes until fork tender. Potatoes can be cooked in microwave, instead.  Melt butter in medium saucepan.  Slowly blend in flour with a wire whisk until thoroughly blended.  Gradually add milk to the butter/flour mixture, whisking constantly.  Whisk in salt and pepper and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally.  Cut potatoes in half, scoop out the meat and set aside.  Chop 1/2 the potato peels and discard the remainder.  When milk mixture is very hot, whisk in potatoes. Add green onion and potato peels.  Whisk well, add sour cream and crumbled bacon.  Heat thoroughly.  Add cheese a little at a time until all is melted.
