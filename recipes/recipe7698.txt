      Brown  hamburger.   Cook  and drain  dried  beans.  Mix hamburger, beans, sauce, oregano and ketchup.  Rinse spaghetti sauce jars with water  and  add.  Simmer  until hot.  Layer on serving plates the corn chips on bottom, bean mixture, cheese, etc.  Each person makes their  own with what they want and how much.  Some of us like  to put mayonnaise or salad dressing on top.
