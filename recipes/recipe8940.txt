DEEP DISH TURKEY PIE


1 (18 oz.)  can vacuum-pack sweet potatoes
2  c. cut up cooked turkey
1  medium onion, chopped (about 1/2 c.)
1 (10 oz.)  pkg. frozen green peas, broken apart
1 (1 oz.)  pkg. chicken gravy mix
1  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. grated lemon peel
  Sweet Potato Biscuits

      Heat oven to 400 degrees;. Mash enough of the sweet potatoes to measure 1/4 cup; reserve for Sweet Potato Biscuits. Cut remaining sweet potatoes into 1/2-inch slices.
      Alternate layers of turkey, onion, frozen peas and sweet potato slices in ungreased 2-quart casserole. Prepare gravy mix as directed on package, except stir in salt and lemon peel. Pour into casserole. Bake, uncovered, 15 minutes.
      Prepare Sweet Potato Biscuits dough. Drop half of the dough (5 to 7 spoonfuls) onto hot turkey pie. Bake until biscuit topping is light brown, about 20 minutes. Makes 6 servings.
