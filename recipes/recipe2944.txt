GOAT CHEESE TORTA


6  oz. goat cheese
4  oz. cream cheese, softened
8  cloves garlic, crushed and finely chopped
  salt and pepper to taste
1/2  c. pesto
1/2  c. finely chopped oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
  sprigs of fresh herbs
1 large baguette, cut into 1/4 to 1/2-inch  slices (I use Melba toast)

      Line a 2 to 3-cup bowl with plastic wrap. Combine goat cheese, cream cheese and garlic in a bowl; mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon half of the cheese mixture into a prepared bowl. Spread with tomatoes. Spread with Pesto. Spoon half of the remaining cheese mixture over the pesto. (Sprinkle cheese mixture over the pesto.) Chill, covered with plastic wrap, for 2 to 6 hours. Invert onto a serving platter. Garnish with fresh herbs. Serve with baguette slices. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
