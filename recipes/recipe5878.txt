STRAWBERRY NUT SALAD


2  regular or 1 large strawberry jello
1  c. boiling water
1 (1 lb. 4 oz.)  can crushed pineapple, drained
3  bananas, mashed
1  c. coarsely chopped pecans
1  pt. sour cream
2 (10 oz.)  pkg. frozen strawberries, thawed

      In a large bowl, combine jello and water, stirring until jello is dissolved. Then fold in all at once the strawberries with juice, drained pineapple, bananas and pecans. Turn half of strawberry mixture into 12 x 8 x 2 dish as the first layer. Refrigerate until firm.
       Then spread the first layer with sour cream. Gently spoon on the rest of the strawberry mixture and refrigerate again until firm.
      I put this in just a regular bowl and dip it as it is served.
