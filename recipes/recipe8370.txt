BAKED MACARONI AND CHEESE


2  Tbsp. butter
2  Tbsp. flour
1/4  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. pepper
1  c. milk
2  tsp. onion, grated
1/2  lb. cheese, grated
2  c. medium white sauce

	To Make White Sauce: Melt butter over low heat in a heavy saucepan. Use a wooden spoon or whisk to stir. Blend in flour and seasonings. Cook over low heat, stirring until smooth and bubbly. Remove from heat. Stir in milk. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil 1 minute. Makes 1 cup. (Double White Sauce recipe.)
	Add onions and half grated cheese to medium White Sauce. Blend well. Cook macaroni; drain and rinse. Alternate sauce and noodles. Sprinkle with crumbs, cheese and paprika. Bake, uncovered, in 375 degrees; oven about 25 minutes or until crumbs are brown. Serves 6 to 8.
	Add hard-cooked eggs in layers, if desired.
