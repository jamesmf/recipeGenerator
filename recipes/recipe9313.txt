MISS LOIS' CHICKEN PIE

Base Mixture:
1  chicken, whole
2  stalks celery, chopped
1  onion, chopped
10  oz. (1 can) soup, chicken or mushroom
3  eggs, boiled and sliced

      In a 4-quart pan (or pressure cooker) put chicken, celery, onion and just enough water to cover chicken.  Boil (or pressure cook) mixture until chicken is tender.
      Retain 1 1/2 to 2 cups broth to be used later.  Debone cooked chicken and cut into pieces.  Place chicken pieces on the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish.  Place sliced eggs over chicken pieces.  Mix 1 1/2 to 2 cups of the reserved chicken broth with soup and pour over the chicken and eggs in the dish.
Crust:
1 1/2  c. self-rising flour
1/2  c. (1 stick) margarine, melted
1  c. milk

      Mix all ingredients together.  Drop crust mixture by spoonfuls on top of pie.
      Bake at 350 degrees; for 45 minutes (or until brown).
