CREAMY LOUISIANA RED BEANS


1  lb. dried red kidney beans
4  Tbsp. fat or drippings
1  large onion, minced
5 or 6  c. water
1  clove garlic, minced
2  bay leaves
2  sprigs thyme
  red pepper seeds (from pod) or few drops hot pepper sauce
  salt to taste
1  ham hock

      Wash and pick over red beans, then soak overnight or 6 to 8 hours in enough water to cover.  Then drain beans and place in a large pot or pressure cooker.  Melt fat or drippings in skillet. Add minced onion and saut until golden brown.  Add to red beans along with 5 cups water, seasonings and ham hock.  We always add the salt after beans have cooked for a while, tasting to see how much the ham bone has salted it before putting in any additional salt.  Cover and cook slowly for 3 1/2 to 4 hours or until tender and creamy.
      Additional water may be added as needed.  If pressure cooker is used, set gauge at 15 pounds of pressure and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Serve on fluffy white rice.  Serves 8 to 10.
      (Note:  Pickled pork or a slice of ham may be substituted for ham bone.  It should be browned first in a small amount of fat before onions are saut√©d.)
