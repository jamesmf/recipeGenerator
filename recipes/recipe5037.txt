OYSTER STEW


3  pt. milk
1  pt. water
1  Tbsp. salt (scant)
1 (10 oz.)  can oysters

      Sometimes I only use the liquid and a few oysters.
      Bring  milk,  water  and  salt to boil.  Let boil a few minutes.  Add  oysters.  Keep  over heat for a few minutes but do not boil, then reduce heat and let stand until oysters come to the top,  then  use low heat 5 or 10 more minutes or until oysters disappear from top.  Add 3 tablespoons butter.  Serve hot with crackers.
