COUNTRY PORK RIBS


2 1/2  lb. pork chops, all fat removed
1  clove garlic, crushed
1/2  lb. dried fruit, mixed
3  Tbsp. unsweetened orange concentrate
3  Tbsp. dried onion flakes
1  tsp. prepared mustard
  salt and pepper to taste

      Rub ribs with crushed garlic and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in roasting pan, rib side down,in 350 degrees; oven.  While ribs are roasting, put dried fruit in saucepan, barely cover with water and simmer covered for 35 minutes.  After ribs have cooked for 1 hour, add the fruit and its cooking liquid and continue roasting for an additional 30 minutes.  Make glaze by combining unsweetened orange juice concentrate, onion flakes and mustard.  Spread over ribs and roast another 15 minutes, basting frequently.  If ribs don't appear nicely browned, bake a little longer until they have a pleasing color.  Cut the ribs into serving size pieces and arrange along with the fruit on a platter.  A green vegetable and salad will finish meal.
