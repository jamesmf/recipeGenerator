YUMMY SALAD


1 large  bunch Romaine lettuce
1  c. vegetable oil
1  large carrot (chopped or grated)
1  c. white vinegar
1/3  med. Red onion (chopped)
1  c. sugar
1  pkg. ramen noodles (crushed)
3  Tbsp. soy sauce
1  c. slivered almonds
6  uncooked bacon slices

      Combine lettuce, carrot, and onion in large salad bowl.  Cook bacon slices and save bacon grease for later.  Crumble bacon into small bits.  Mix ramen noodles and almonds on a cookie sheet. Lightly coat the noodle/almond mixture with the bacon grease. Brown the mixture in toaster (or conventional) oven.  Make dressing by combining vegetable oil, vinegar, sugar, and soy sauce in a sauce pan.  Simmer sauce until sugar is dissolved.  Set aside to cool.  Add bacon bits and the toasted ramen noodles and almonds to salad in bowl.  Mix and serve.  Keep dressing separate from salad until salad is served.  (Salad will not keep very long once dressing is added.)
