PATE MAISON


2  qt. water
2  tsp. peppercorns
2  tsp. whole cloves
3  bay leaves
  few sprigs parsley
2 1/2  lb. very fresh chicken livers
2  c. (1 lb.) butter, softened
1  small onion, finely chopped
1  large garlic clove, minced
1  Tbsp. salt
2  tsp. dry mustard
1/2  tsp. nutmeg
  dash of hot pepper sauce
1/4  c. brandy

      Combine water, peppercorns, whole cloves, bay leaves and parsley in a 4-quart saucepan.  Bring to a boil, simmer 10 minutes and strain.  Add chicken livers to liquid.  Cook just below simmering point until liquid is clear and livers are done, about 10 minutes.  Drain livers and put once through food grinder.  Set aside.  In large mixing bowl, blend together remaining ingredients except brandy.  Add liver and mix until smooth.  Stir in brandy. Line a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with aluminum foil.  Pack pate into pan. Chill thoroughly before serving.  Flavor will develop more fully if allowed to chill overnight.
