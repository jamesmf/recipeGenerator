SCOTCH EGGS


4  hard-boiled eggs, shelled
  Worcestershire or steak sauce
1  beaten egg
  Deep fat
2 level  tsp. seasoned flour
1/2  lb. sausage meat
  Dry bread crumbs

      Dust the eggs with seasoned flour.  (Season the flour with your favorite spices.)  Add a few drops of the sauce to the sausage meat and divide into 4 equal portions.  Form each quarter into a flat cake and work it around the egg, making it as even as possible to keep the egg a good shape and making sure there are no cracks in the sausage meat.  Brush with beaten egg and toss in the breadcrumbs.  Heat the fat until it will brown a cube of bread in 40 to 50 seconds.  (As the sausage meat is raw, it is essential that the frying should not be hurried unduly, as the fat must not get too hot and the sausage must get cooked all the way through.) Fry the eggs for about 7 to 8 minutes. When they are golden brown on the outside, remove them from the fat and drain on crumpled kitchen paper.  Cut the eggs in half lengthwise. Garnish each half with a small piece of parsley and serve either hot with tomato sauce, or cold with a green salad.
