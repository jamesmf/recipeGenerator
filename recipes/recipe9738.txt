SCHNEIDER MEAT BALLS


1  can cream of mushroom soup
1/2  c. water
1 1/2  lb. ground beef
1/4  c. fine cracker crumbs
2  Tbsp. dried onion soup
1  Tbsp. minced parsley
1  egg

      Mix together the soup and water. Combine the next 5 ingredients and add 1/4 of the soup mixture. Mix well. Shape into small balls (keeping hands wet to prevent sticking). Brown in 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet. Pour off drippings. Add remaining soup mixture (for more gravy, add 1 more can cream of mushroom soup). Cover and cook over low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve over potatoes, rice or egg noodles.
