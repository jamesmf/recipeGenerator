SOUTHERN BISCUITS


1  c. plus 2 Tbsp. flour
1  tsp. baking powder
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. baking soda
2  Tbsp. Crisco or butter
1/2  c. buttermilk
1  Tbsp. Crisco for frying pan

      Mix the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl.  Blend in the 2 tablespoons Crisco until the mixture is coarse and grainy, using a pastry blender.  Then, using a fork, stir in the buttermilk.  Do not overmix.  Put on a floured board and knead just a few times.  Pat out the dough to about 1/2-inch thickness.  Cut with a floured biscuit cutter or a glass.  Do not handle the dough too much or it will get tough.
      Place 1 tablespoon of Crisco in a heavy black iron frying pan and put the pan in the oven at 500 degrees; for about 7 minutes.  Remove the pan and place the biscuits in it, turning each once in the oil. Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown.
