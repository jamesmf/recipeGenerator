      Mix gelatin, 3/4 cup sugar and salt in top of double boiler. Beat milk and egg yolks together.  Add gelatin mixture.

      While mixture is chilling, prepare crumb topping by mixing graham cracker crumbs with melted margarine.  Beat cottage cheese on high speed for 3 minutes.  Then add to chilled mixture.  Beat egg whites stiff; then beat in 1/4 cup sugar into gelatin mix. Fold in whipping cream and yellow food color.  Garnish cheese cake with pineapple or cherries.  Serves 12.
