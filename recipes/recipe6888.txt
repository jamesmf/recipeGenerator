STICKY CHICKEN


1  whole chicken, cut up
2  chicken bouillon cubes
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper
  salt

	Clean and wash chicken. Take off skin and fat. Put in pot with no oil. Add salt, pepper and bouillon cubes. Start on low heat (chicken will make water). Stir well and cook until tender. You may need to add a little water. Fry down to brown. Add leftover cooked rice to pot after you take out chicken and mix together to make sticky rice.
