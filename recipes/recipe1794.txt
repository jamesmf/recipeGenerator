FETTUCCINE ALFREDO


1  lb. fresh fettucine
  boiling salted water
1  c. butter, softened
1/3 to 1/2  c. freshly grated Parmesan
  freshly cracked pepper
  additional grated Parmesan cheese

      Drop fettuccine in the boiling water and cook until fettuccine comes to the surface, about 2 minutes.  Drain at once and quickly place in warm bowl in which half the softened butter has been placed.  Top with lumps of remaining butter and the cheese.  Toss lightly, using fork and spoon, for about 2 minutes, until fettuccine is well coated and creamy sauce has formed.  Serve sprinkled with freshly cracked pepper and additional grated cheese. Makes 4 servings.
