PICKLED OKRA


1  clove garlic for each jar
1  hot pepper for each jar
1  c. salt
1  qt. white vinegar
1  c. water
  small okra

      Place 1 garlic clove and 1 pepper in each hot, sterilized jar. Pack firmly with clean young okra from which only part of the stem has been removed. Bring water, salt, and vinegar to a boil; simmer 5 minutes. Pour boiling hot solution over okra. Seal immediately. This will make 7 to 8 pints of pickled okra.
