CHICKEN MIX


4  fryers, cut up or whole
4  qt. water
3  Tbsp. parsley
4  carrots, peeled and chopped
4  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. pepper
2  tsp. basil
3  to 4 stalks celery, including tops
  other seasonings, as desired (I use thyme, seasoned salt, onion and celery salt and minced onion)

      Combine all ingredients in a large kettle and bring to a boil; cover and reduce heat to just simmering.  Cook until chicken is very tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Remove chicken and place on a cookie sheet to cool.  Strain broth and cool; then refrigerate until fat is hardened.  Discard fat if desired. Debone chicken and discard bones and skin.  Package about 2 cups of chicken per container;  package broth separately, about 2 cups per container.  Be sure to label carefully.  May be used for noodles, dumplings, chicken pie, chicken salad, chicken enchiladas, etc. Makes about 6 pints of chicken and 6 pints of broth.
