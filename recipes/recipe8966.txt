BLACK BASS WITH OYSTER STUFFING


3 to 4  c. cornbread stuffing (I make homemade)
1  c. oysters
2  (3 to 4 lb.) black bass
1/2  c. butter, divided evenly

      In a skillet, melt 1/4 cup butter. When hot, add 1 cup drained oysters. Watch out, they pop and spit a little. Turn until done (they will harden). Then dice. Add to prepared stuffing. Mix well.
      Take the black bass and scale them, but leave skin on. Split bass lengthways and debone them. Place 2 fillets in prepared Pyrex dish, skin side down. Cover with oyster stuffing, then place other 2 fillets on top, skin side up. Bake at 350 degrees; for 1 hour or until fish flakes easily with fork. Serve hot.
