GWEN'S TACO DISH


2  lb. lean ground beef
1  can (10 3/4-oz.) condensed cream of mushroom soup
1  can (15 oz.) mild enchilada sauce
1  medium onion, finely chopped
1  can (16-oz.) mild kidney beans or pinto beans
1  green bell pepper, chopped
3  c. shredded Cheddar cheese
1  pkg. (12) corn tortillas

      Brown the ground beef until crumbly; drain the fat.  Combine the beef, soups, and enchilada sauce.  Cut the corn tortillas into halves or fourths; place on the bottom of a 9-inch by 13-inch baking dish.  Add ground beef mixture; then a layer of onion, green pepper, and beans.  On top of that a layer of cheddar cheese.  Repeat the layers, beginning with tortilla pieces and ending with cheese.  Place a ring of tortillas cut into halves around the edges of the baking dish on top of the cheese layer. (These will brown and crisp during baking.)  Bake at 350 degrees; for about 1 hour.  Serve with lettuce and tomatoes, and/or rice on the side.  Makes 6 servings.
