GREEK SESAME SEED CANDY


1/2  lb. honey
1/2  lb. sesame seeds
  orange water*

      Put the honey in a heavy saucepan and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes.  Stir in the sesame seeds.  Continue cooking, stirring constantly, for five minutes.  Pour a little orange water on a tray or marble board.  Tilt it several times so that the whole tray is moistened.  Pour on the honey mixture and spread it to a thickness of 1/2-inch.  Let the candy cool at room temperature.  Cut it into 1-inch squares.  Turn the pieces with a spatula and let them dry on a rack for 2 or 3 hours.  Store between layers of waxed paper in an airtight container.  Makes about 3 dozen pieces.
      *Orange water can be purchased at specialty food stores or plain water may be substituted.
      Sesame seeds are the oldest seeds known to have been used as spices in cooking.  This sesame honey candy was made in Greece thousands of years ago.
