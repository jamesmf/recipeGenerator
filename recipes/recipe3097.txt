MARINATED MUSHROOMS


1  lb. fresh mushrooms
1/4  c. olive oil
1/2  c. wine vinegar
1/2  onion, finely chopped
1  clove garlic

	If mushrooms are very small, leave on stems; if large, remove stems and save for some other dish. Cook mushrooms in boiling salted water for 10 minutes; drain well.
	 Make a French dressing with the remaining ingredients and marinate mushrooms for at least 12 hours. Serve on picks.
