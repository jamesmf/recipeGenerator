	Fill large pot one-half full of water with 3 bags of shrimp/crab boil, 2 beers, squeeze lemon and lime in and throw in rinds.  Bring to hard boil and let boil 10 to 15 minutes.  Add sausage and cook 12 minutes.  Then add corn to sausage and cook another 8 minutes.	Then add shrimp to corn and sausage and cook 6 minutes.  DO NOT OVERCOOK THE SHRIMP.
	 After the shrimp have been in the water 6 minutes, IMMEDIATELY REMOVE SHRIMP and arrange on a platter and sprinkle with lots of Old Bay seafood seasoning. Check to see if corn is tender. If not, cook until corn is tender (but  not soggy) and then remove corn and sausage from boiling water.
