PORK AND SAUERKRAUT WITH DUMPLINGS


3 or 4  lb. pork roast
2  c. flour
1  tsp. salt
1 (27 oz.)  can sauerkraut
  sour cream
  frozen spaetzle
1/4  c. butter or margarine
1  Tbsp. brown sugar

	Wrap meat in foil and roast in 425 degrees; oven. When done, cut or shred meat into small pieces. Make dumplings by mixing flour, salt and sour cream until dough feels like biscuit batter. Make dumplings about the size of the end of your finger. Drop into boiling water. Cook about 5 minutes. Mix sauerkraut and pork with the butter and a tablespoon of brown sugar. When heated, add dumplings and serve.
