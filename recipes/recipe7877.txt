TIMATAR KEEMA
(Ground Beef-Stuffed Tomatoes)  

3  large, ripe beefsteak tomatoes
1  lb. ground beef
1/2  tsp. each, garlic and ginger paste
1  tsp. salt
1-1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper
1/2  tsp. paprika
1  tsp. cumin powder
1/4  tsp. monosodium glutamate
1/8  tsp. black pepper powder
1  medium onion, coarsely chopped
  Cooking oil
1/8  cup chopped cilantro
1/8  cup chopped green onions

      Wash and dry tomatoes.  Leave stems intact.  Cut 1-inch off the top of each tomato (save the lids!)  Using a spoon and knife, gently scoop out the soft insides of each tomato and reserve for later use.  Cover tomatoes and lids and keep aside.
      To the ground beef, add garlic, ginger, salt, cayenne, cumin powder, msg, pepper and the reserved tomatoes.  Mix well.  Heat some oil in a pot and braise the onions until golden. Add the ground beef and saut√© for 8-10 minutes.  When ground beef starts releasing water, cover and cook over low heat for 10-15 minutes. Mix in cilantro and green onions.  Let cool 5-10 minutes.
      Fill each tomato with the ground beef and cover with it's lid. Transfer remaining ground beef to an oven-proof dish and top with the stuffed tomatoes.  Sprinkle with water and cover tightly with foil.  Bake in a warm (300 degrees;F) oven for 20-25 minutes.
