DUTCH CHOCOLATE BIRTHDAY CAKE


1  c. sifted unsweetened cocoa
2  c. boiling water
3  c. sifted all-purpose flour
2  tsp. baking soda
3/4  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. baking powder
1  c. soft butter
2 1/2  c. granulated sugar
4  eggs
1 1/2  tsp. vanilla

 
Chocolate Filling:
1  c. soft butter
1  c. 10x sugar
1/2  c. unsweetened cocoa
2  eggs

      In medium bowl, combine cocoa with boiling water, mixing well. Let cool completely.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Lightly grease and flour three 9-inch layer cake pans.  Sift flour with baking soda, salt and baking powder; set aside.  In a large bowl, mix butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add flour in fourths, alternately with cocoa mixture, in thirds, beginning and ending with flour.  Do not overbeat.  Pour into prepared pans.  Bake 30 minutes or until surface springs back when gently pressed with fingertip.  Cool 10 minutes.  Remove from pans; cool thoroughly on wire racks.
      Meanwhile, make chocolate filling.  Cream butter until smooth. Add sugar, cocoa and eggs.  Spread filling on layers and cool completely.
Seven Minute Frosting:
2  egg whites
1 1/2  c. granulated sugar
1/2  c. water
1  Tbsp. white corn syrup
1/2  tsp. salt
1  tsp. vanilla

      In double boiler top, combine all ingredients, except vanilla. With electric mixer at high speed, beat about 1 minute to blend; then place over rapidly boiling water and beat until mixture forms peaks when beater is raised (may take longer than 7 minutes). Remove from boiling water; empty into large bowl.  Add vanilla; continue beating until thick enough to spread.  Frost cake layers; decorate as desired.  Jelly beans or Christmas candies are pretty, as the occasion would demand.  This is also a nice frosting for coconut cake, using almond extract or coconut.  Use this frosting to ice the Dutch Chocolate birthday cake.
