STEW


1  lb. peeled shrimp, beef meat or chicken
2  medium onions, chopped fine
1/2  medium bell pepper, chopped fine
3  green onion tops, chopped fine
1  c. oil or a little more
1  c. flour (remember equal amounts of flour and oil)
1  tsp. parsley flakes
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper
2  medium potatoes, cut up
1  tsp. minced garlic
2  chicken bouillon cubes (for chicken)

	Make roux with equal amounts of oil and flour. Brown until it looks like a reddish color appears. Add onions and cook until tender, then add peppers, garlic, parsley flakes and onion tops and cook until golden.
	 If using beef, cut into bite size pieces and add to roux and cook to brown meat awhile. Then add water and cook until meat is tender. You can add potatoes, cut up, about 10 minutes before stew is done.
	If using chicken, add the 2 chicken bouillon cubes and chicken after it is clean and washed. Do the same as for beef; cook in roux for awhile, then add water and cook until thick and tender.
	If you are using shrimp, do everything as instructed, then add water to roux first and cook about 20 minutes before adding shrimp. While the roux is cooking, defrost shrimp and put in pot. You can add potatoes at the end (about 10 minutes before it is finished cooking).
	 Cook on medium-low heat. When you see a skin form over the top of stew and the meat is tender, then your stew is done.
