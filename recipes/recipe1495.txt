GRILLED ONIONS


12  to 15 small white onions
  oleo or butter
  salt and pepper

      Peel onions and rinse.  Tear aluminum foil into pieces slightly larger than onions.  Cut each onion in half and place both halves on a square of foil.  Put a pat of butter or oleo between the halves of an onion; salt and pepper to taste.  Wrap thoroughly. Continue with all onions.  Cook by placing foil packets around outside edge of grill while the meat cooks.  Onions are done when they can be pierced easily with a fork.
