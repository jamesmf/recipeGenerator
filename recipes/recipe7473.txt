WESTERN LITE BROIL


2  lb. beef flank or sirloin steak, cut into 4-oz. portions
1  c. soy sauce
1/2  c. water
1/4  c. lemon juice
1/4  c. honey
2  green onions and tops, chopped
1/2  tsp. garlic powder

      Combine soy sauce, water, lemon juice, honey, onions, and garlic powder.  Add steak and turn to coat thoroughly.  For best results, marinate 24 hours.  Broil beef to medium rare (do not overcook).  Cut across grain into thin slices.  Sprinkle lightly with toasted sesame seeds, if desired.  Serves 6 to 8.
