CHICKEN TETRAZZINI


1 (8 oz.)  pkg. spaghetti, cooked
3  c. cooked chicken, chopped
2  cans cream of mushroom soup
2  small onions, chopped fine
1  green pepper, chopped fine
1  c. celery, chopped fine
  grated cheese

      Break spaghetti into small pieces and cook in the chicken broth that has been saved from cooking the chicken for extra flavor.  Cook onions, pepper and celery together in a small amount of margarine until tender.  Grease a large casserole dish (or 2 medium dishes).  Layer half of spaghetti, half of chicken, half of onion mixture and one can of mushroom soup.  Repeat this procedure to make the second layer.  Top with grated cheese and bake about 30 minutes at 375 degrees; until cheese melts and is bubbly.
