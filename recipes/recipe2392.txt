BUTTERMILK PIE



1  c. butter or margarine, melted
1/2  c. flour
3  c. sugar
1  c. buttermilk
1  tsp. salt
2  tsp. vanilla
6  eggs, beaten
2  (9-inch) deep-dish unbaked pie shells

      Mix sugar and butter until well creamed.  Add beaten eggs. Slowly add flour, vanilla and milk.  Beat at high speed until mixed well.  Pour into unbaked pie shells.  Bake at 350 degrees; until brown on top, about 5 minutes.  You should put foil on edges of crusts to keep them from browning too fast.
