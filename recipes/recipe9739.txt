SPICY CHICKEN ENCHILADAS

Meat Preparation:
2  whole chickens
1 to 2  c. water
1/4 to 1/2  c. soy sauce
1/4 to 1/2  c. Italian dressing
  salt and pepper

 
Filling:
1 to 2  c. chopped onion
1/2 to 1  c. chopped black olives
1  c. chopped mushrooms
1 to 3  tsp. chopped garlic
2  cans chopped green chilies
1 to 2  cans cream of mushroom soup
8 to 12  oz. salsa
4 to 8  oz. taco sauce (mild, medium or hot to preference)
1 to 2  Tbsp. chili powder
1  tsp. cumin
1 to 2  c. shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 to 1  c. sour cream

      Bake chickens in the oven, covered, at about 325 degrees; for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours (depending on how big the chicken is). Cover chicken with water, soy sauce and Italian dressing, salt and pepper. Drain chicken and cool. Cool drained broth overnight in the refrigerator and skim off the fat. Debone the chicken and chunk the meat.
       Combine chicken and the remaining ingredients. Layer filling with soft flour tortilla shells, beginning with the meat filling (like lasagna). Drizzle 1/4 cup of broth onto and between each layer. Bake at 325 degrees; for at least 1 hour. Best if cooked, cooled and reheated. Top with Cheddar cheese while hot (so that it melts). Serve with taco sauce and sour cream. All ingredients are to taste.
