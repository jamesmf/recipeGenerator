POTATO DUMPLINGS


3  pounds russet potatoes
2  eggs
1  c. all-purpose flour, divided
1/2  c. dry bread crumbs
1  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. ground nutmeg
  dash pepper
  minced fresh parsley, optional

      Place potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30-35 minutes or until tender. Drain well. Refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. Peel and grate potatoes. In a bowl, combine the eggs, 3/4 c. flour, bread crumbs, salt, nutmeg, and pepper. Add potatoes; mix with hands until well blended. Shape into 1-1/2 inch balls; roll in remaining flour.
       In a large kettle, bring salted water to a boil. Add the dumplings, a few at a time, to boiling water. Simmer, uncovered, until the dumplings rise to the top; cook 2 minutes longer. Remove dumplings with a slotted spoon to a serving bowl. Sprinkle with parsley if desired. Yield: 10 servings.
