SOY CHEESE ENCHILADAS


2 1/2  c. enchilada sauce
2  c. soy Cheddar and soy Monterey Jack, shredded
4  green onions, chopped
1  small onion, finely chopped
6  corn tortillas
  canola oil (small amount)

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  In one skillet, warm the enchilada sauce.  Coat the bottom of a shallow baking dish with a little of the enchilada sauce.  In second skillet, brush bottom with a small amount of oil (to keep tortilla from sticking).  Heat skillet. Prepare one tortilla at a time.  Place tortillas in skillet, one at a time, in hot oil.  Hold in skillet 3 to 5 seconds, until soft. Then with tongs, quickly turn to soften the other side. Immediately dip tortilla in skillet with the warming enchilada sauce.  Hold in skillet just for a second or the tortilla will tear.  Place tortilla on plate and spoon soy Cheddar, soy Monterey Jack and onion toward one edge of the tortilla.  Roll up tightly and place seam side down in the baking dish.  When all of the tortillas are filled and in baking dish, pour remaining enchilada sauce over them and sprinkle with soy cheese.  Bake about 15 minutes or until soy cheese has melted and enchiladas are heated through.
      To Serve:  Top with green onions and soy sour cream.
      Note:  Can fill with ground tofu as well.
