CANNOLI
(Cheese Filled Pastry; Italy)  

3  c. all-purpose flour
1/4  c. sugar
4  eggs
2  Tbsp. water
1/2  tsp. salt
3  Tbsp. shortening
1/2  tsp. orange flavoring

      Sift the dry ingredients together.  Rub the shortening into the dry ingredients until it resembles a fine meal.  Beat the eggs, orange flavoring and water together on high speed.  Add this to the meal like mixture and mix together.  Even though it seems dry, do not add more liquid.  Turn this out onto a floured board and knead until a smooth ball is formed.  Let the dough rest about a half hour, then roll into a thin sheet of dough, about 1/8 of an inch thick.  Cut into strips the size of a shell you desire.  Wrap around a metal or wood form and seal edges together with water. Fry in deep hot 360 degrees; fat until brown.  Cool and fill with whipped Ricotta cream, sweetened to taste and flavored with cinnamon and vanilla.  Roll in powdered sugar.
      Hint:  Although Cannoli rings are sold in gourmet food shops, you can easily make your own from a metal shower rod or 1-inch wooden doweling.
