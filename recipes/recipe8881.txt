EVERYDAY MEAT LOAF


2/3  c. dry bread crumbs
1  c. milk
1 1/2  lb. ground beef
2  beaten eggs
1/4  c. grated onion
1  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. sage
  dash of pepper

      Soak bread crumbs in milk; add meat, eggs, onion and seasoning. Mix well; put into pan, greased. Cover with sauce. Bake in moderate oven (350 degrees;) 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Piquant Sauce:
3  Tbsp. brown sugar
1/4  c. catsup
1/4  tsp. nutmeg
1  tsp. dry mustard

      Combine ingredients.
      (It is best to double or triple the sauce mix and just smother the meat loaf in this and use as side dish for dipping while eating meat loaf.) Any meat loaf recipe will do, but the sauce just adds a little extra.
