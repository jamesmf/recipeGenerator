MARGIE'S CELERY SEED DRESSING


1  c. sugar
2  tsp. dry mustard
2/3  c. vinegar
2  tsp. salt
1  medium onion, quartered
2  c. salad oil
2  tsp. celery seed

      Blend together all ingredients except celery seed.  Add celery seed and stir in last.  Chill.
      Cut up bibb lettuce or red leaf lettuce.  Slice approximately 1 pint to 1 quart strawberries.  Chill well. Add dressing just before serving.
      You can make 1/2 of this recipe if you wish.  It keeps refrigerated for a month.
      Another good combination is mandarin oranges, sweet white onion slices and sliced almonds.  This is a good all-around dressing for vegetables and fruits.
