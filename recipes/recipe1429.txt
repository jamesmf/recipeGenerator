1 1/2  lb. boneless chicken or turkey

 
Marinade:
1  small onion, sliced roughly
  1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
6 to 8  cloves garlic, peeled
3  tsp. ground coriander
2  tsp. ground cumin
2  tsp. ground cinnamon
1  tsp. ground cardamon
1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper
3  Tbsp. red wine vinegar
3  Tbsp. sunflower oil
1  Tbsp. tomato sauce

      Slice chicken breasts into thin strips and put into a bowl. Put all ingredients into a blender and blend to a smooth paste.
