SPENATSOPPA
(Spinach Soup)  

1 (10 1/2 oz.)  can cream of chicken soup
2  chicken bouillon cubes
1  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
2  hard-cooked eggs, quartered
1  c. milk
2  c. boiling water
1 (10 oz.)  pkg. frozen chopped spinach, thawed
2  Tbsp. chopped parsley

      Combine the soup, milk and boiling water in a large pan in which you have already dissolved the bouillon cubes.  Chop the spinach finely in a blender or food processor, taking care not to puree.  (You may wish to use some of your liquid with the spinach in order not to puree the spinach.)  Add the spinach to the pan and simmer for 10 minutes.  Add the salt and pepper.  Garnish with the chopped parsley and eggs.
