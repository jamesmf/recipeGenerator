VENISON STROGANOFF


1 1/2  lb. venison, cut in strips
2  Tbsp. oil
1  small onion, chopped
1  can (4 oz.) mushrooms, or more
1  can cream of mushroom or cream of chicken soup
1  c. sour cream (can use plain yogurt)

      In large skillet, saut√© onion.  (I like to add garlic, also.) Add venison and cook until browned.  Add mushrooms and brown, then add soup and sour cream.  Cover and simmer 30 to 60 minutes. Electric fry pan works good.  Serve over hot noodles.
