DAD'S LUPINI'S


  4-5 lb. dried lupini beans (1/2 lb. per jar)
1  lg. strainer
1  lg. spaghetti pot
2   tbsp. salt per jar
  8-10 Mason jars with rings

      Place lupini beans into large pot of water, set aside and soak overnight.  Drain water and refill.  Bring to boil for 10 mins.  Drain water and refill with fresh, cold water.  Let set and then strain and drain water (cleaning both pot and strainer each time, clean water will take residue off) and refill.  I like to do this 4 times a day.  After 4 to 5 days, taste them.  When no longer bitter, they are done.  Add water and salt to jar and cold pack or keep refrigerated.
