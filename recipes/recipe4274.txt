POTATO SOUP


6  to 8 potatoes, peeled and diced
1  small onion, chopped finely
1 (16 oz.)  can evaporated milk
2  cans cream of chicken soup
1  can cream of celery soup
  butter, salt and pepper to taste
  shredded cheese
  crumbled bacon or bacon bits

      Place potatoes and onion in a 4-quart saucepan. Cover with about 6 cups of water, butter, salt and pepper to taste. Cook until potatoes are done (about 15 to 20 minutes). Drain water until potatoes are just covered. Add milk and soups. Heat should be very low at this point. Cook only until thoroughly heated. Garnish with bacon and cheese.
