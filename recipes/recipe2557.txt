SWEET-SOUR PORK SAUSAGE BALLS

Meatballs:
1  lb. bulk pork sausage
1  slightly beaten egg
1/3  c. fine bread crumbs
1/2  tsp. sage

 
Sauce:
1/2  c. catsup
2  Tbsp. brown sugar
1  Tbsp. vinegar
1  Tbsp. soy sauce

      Mix sausage, egg, bread crumbs and sage.  Shape into about 2 dozen 1 1/2 inch balls.  In ungreased skillet, brown balls slowly on all sides, about 15 minutes.  Pour off grease.  Combine ingredients for sauce; pour over meat.  Cover and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to coat meat balls.  Can be served as an appetizer (if meat balls are made smaller).  Serve over rice as a main dish.
