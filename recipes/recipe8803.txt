SPAGHETTI SAUCE

Vegetables:
30  to 40 tomatoes
2  green peppers, chopped
2  to 3 onions, chopped
3  stalks celery, chopped
1  lb. fresh mushrooms

 
Meats:
1 1/2  lb. hamburg
12  to 14 links "hot" sausage

 
Spices:
1 1/2  Tbsp. oregano
1  Tbsp. basil leaves, chopped
1 1/2  Tbsp. parsley
1  tsp. celery salt
1  tsp. garlic powder
1/2  tsp. nutmeg
1/4  tsp. cinnamon
6  to 8 bay leaves
  salt and pepper to taste

      Peel and cook tomatoes in large pot until they become liquid (about 1 hour).  Add peppers, onions and celery.  Slice and add mushrooms.  Add all spices and continue simmering. Add the links of sausage (whole) and let the sauce cook until it thickens (about 3 hours).  In the meantime, cook the hamburg in a frying pan with 1 chopped onion and dash of Worcestershire sauce (to taste).  Add hamburg to tomato sauce mixture as soon as meat is cooked.  If the sauce will not thicken, add a 12-ounce can of tomato paste.
