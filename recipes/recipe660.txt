      Peel and cut tomatoes into small pieces.  Cook about 15 minutes.  Put into blender for 10 seconds; return to pot.  Saut√© onion, pepper, celery and garlic just until onion is transparent. Add to tomatoes.  Add salt, pepper, sugar and spices.  Cover and simmer at least 1 hour, longer if you can as the flavor improves the longer it cooks.  Taste and add more seasonings if needed.
