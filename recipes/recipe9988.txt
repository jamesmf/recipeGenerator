FRESH SNAP BEANS


  snap beans
1  onion
1/2  tsp. minced garlic
1  to 2 potatoes
1/2  tsp. minced garlic
3  Tbsp. cooking oil
1/4  tsp. cayenne
  salt to taste
1  tsp. flour (all-purpose)

	Sort and wash beans; snip off ends and snap into desired lengths. Boil until tender. Take out what you want to cook and freeze the rest, water and all. Fill the bag with beans first (quart about 3/4 of the way), then separate the water you boiled and the beans to fill your bags for the freezer. Put some of the bean water and then fill with tap water to finish the bag.
	 To cook, put oil in a pot and add your chopped onion; cook until clear. Add beans and minced garlic; smother for 15 to 20 minutes or until they start to fry down. When this happens, add a little water and lower fire. When they fry down again, add your potatoes, cut up, and flour. Mix well and finish cooking with a little more water. Cook until tender.
	 (If you use canned beans, drain water and smother down 1 time. Add potatoes and flour. Stir and cook on low heat until potatoes are tender.)
