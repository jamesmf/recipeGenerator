SHRIMP CURRY


2  c. uncooked Asian or basmati rice
2  lb. medium shrimp (18 to 24 shrimp), peeled and set aside
1/4  c. olive oil
2  Tbsp. minced garlic
1/2  c. water chestnuts, sliced, rinsed and drained on paper towel
2  cans unsweetened coconut milk
1  c. Asian fish sauce or clam juice
1/2  tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
1/2  c. green onion, minced
2 green onions, cut in thin  slices on a diagonal
4  Tbsp. lime juice
1 1/2  tsp. Garam Masala curry paste
2  Tbsp. cornstarch, mixed with 3 Tbsp. water
1/4  c. chopped fresh cilantro

      Put rice in a saucepan and add cold water to cover by 3/4-inch.  Bring to a boil, uncovered.  Turn the heat down to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.  Remove from heat and let it stand, covered, for at least 10 to 15 minutes.  While rice is cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it is hot, but not smoking.  Add shrimp and saut√© for 3 minutes, moving the pan continuously to avoid sticking or burning. With a slotted spoon, remove cooked shrimp and set aside.  Turn heat down to medium-low and add garlic, chestnuts, coconut milk, fish sauce, pepper flakes, minced onion, lime juice and curry mix. Simmer for 6 to 8 minutes.  Add cornstarch paste and simmer for 5 more minutes, until mixture thickens. Put shrimp back into the sauce along with cilantro and half the sliced green onion.  Simmer for 3 more minutes.  Transfer to a heated serving bowl and garnish with remaining sliced green onion.  Makes 5 servings.
