PORCUPINE MEAT BALLS


1  lb. ground meat
1/2  small onion, chopped
1/2  bell pepper, chopped
  7-10 crackers crushed
1  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
1/4  c. catsup (optional)
3/4  c. uncooked rice
1  c. water
1  egg
  salt and pepper to taste

      Combine all ingredients, then form meat balls. Put meat balls in 9 x 12 x 2 inch baking pan or any pan close to that size. A deep iron skillet works good. Pour one family size can of tomato sauce over meat balls. Add salt and pepper to taste. Bake in oven at 350 degrees; for 45 minutes uncovered.
