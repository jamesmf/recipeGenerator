SQUASH AND CHEESE SOUFFLE


1 1/2  c. cooked mashed squash
2  eggs, well beaten
2  c. shredded Cheddar cheese (sharp preferred)
6  or 8 crushed crackers
1/3  stick melted margarine
1 1/2  c. milk
1/2  tsp. salt
1  tsp. pepper
  paprika

      Cook and mash the squash, adding onion if desired.  (I cook mine in the microwave in the same casserole it will be served in. Add a tablespoon or two of water, cover and microwave until tender.)  Mix together the eggs, squash (and onion), cheese, milk, salt and pepper.  Pour into a greased casserole.  Top with the crushed crackers.  Drizzle with margarine.  Sprinkle with paprika. Bake at 350 degrees; for 35 minutes or until puffed and golden.  Good leftover, too!
