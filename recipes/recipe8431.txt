SUSAN'S CRUSTLESS BREAKFAST BAKE


12  c. trimmed fresh spinach leaves
2  Tbsp. unsalted butter
3/4  c. chopped, peeled shallots
3  plum tomatoes
1  c. milk
2  eggs
3/4  c. shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/4  tsp. chopped fresh dill
2  tsp. grated lemon zest
1/2  tsp. salt
  freshly ground pepper to taste
1  Tbsp. dried breadcrumbs
1  Tbsp. freshly grated Parmesan cheese

      Rinse the spinach well and place it in a large saucepan with just the water that clings to the leaves.  Place the saucepan over low heat and stir to wilt the spinach, 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain well, squeezing out excess moisture.  Chop coarsely; set aside.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Melt the butter in a small skillet and saut√© shallots over medium low heat until translucent, 5 minutes; set aside.  Halve tomatoes and squeeze, releasing and discarding the seeds and juice.  Coarsely chop and set aside.  In medium-size bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, Monterey Jack cheese, dill, lemon zest, salt and pepper.  Stir in the reserved spinach, tomatoes and shallots.  Thoroughly butter an 8-inch square baking pan.  Add the filling and sprinkle with the breadcrumbs and Parmesan.  Bake until golden, 25 minutes.  Let the quiche stand for 10 minutes before serving.
