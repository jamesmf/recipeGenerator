EGG CASSEROLE


1/2  c. onion, chopped
2  Tbsp. butter or margarine

1  c. sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded
6  hard-boiled eggs, peeled and sliced or quartered
1 1/2  c. potato chips, crushed
10 to 12  slices bacon, fried crisp and crumbled

	In a large skillet, cook onion in butter until tender, but not brown. Blend flour and milk; cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens. Add cheese and stir until melted. Place half the egg slices into bottom of a lightly greased 10 x 6 x 1-inch dish. Cover with half the cheese sauce, half the potato chips and half the crumbled bacon. Repeat layers. Bake in preheated 350 degrees; oven for 30 minutes or until hot and bubbling.
