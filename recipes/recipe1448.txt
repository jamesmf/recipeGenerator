MARINATED STEAK


1  flank steak
2  Tbsp. salad oil
1/3  c. soy sauce
1  Tbsp. red wine vinegar
2  Tbsp. honey or firmly packed brown sugar
1  tsp. freshly grated ginger
1/2  clove garlic, crushed

      Combine oil, soy sauce, honey or brown sugar, vinegar, ginger and garlic.  Marinate 8 hours in this mixture for delicate flavor, overnight for more pronounced flavor.  Poke meat with two prong fork while marinating.  Use sauce to brush on while cooking.  Cook 4 to 5 minutes on each side.  (Better cooked on grill, but can use broiler.)  Carve diagonally in 1/4 inch strips.
