PIZZA ROLL-UPS


1/2  lb. ground beef
1 (8 oz.)  can tomato sauce
1/2  c. shredded Mozzarella cheese
1/2  tsp. dried oregano
2  (8 oz.) tubes refrigerated crescent rolls

      In a skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink. Drain.  Remove from the heat.  Add tomato sauce, Mozzarella cheese and oregano.  Mix well.  Separate crescent dough into eight rectangles, pinching seams together.  Place about 3 tablespoons of meat mixture along one long side of each rectangle.  Roll up, jelly roll style, starting with a long side.  Cut each roll into three pieces.  Place, seam side down, 2-inches apart on greased baking sheets.  Bake at 375 degrees; for 15 minutes or until golden brown.  Yield: 2 dozen.
