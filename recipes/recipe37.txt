2  tsp. vanilla
2  c. flour
1  (6 oz.) miniature semi-sweet chocolate pieces
1/2  c. chopped pecans
1/4  c. sifted powdered sugar

      In a large bowl, beat butter on medium speed for 30 seconds. Add sugar; beat until fluffy.  Add water and vanilla; beat well. Stir in flour, half of the chocolate pieces and the pecans.  Shape dough into 1 1/2 x 1/2-inch crescents.  Place on ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake at 325 degrees; for 25 minutes.  Cool.
      In a plastic bag, gently shake a few cookies at a time in powdered sugar.  Melt together the remaining chocolate pieces and the shortening.  Dip one end of each cookie into the melted chocolate mixture.
