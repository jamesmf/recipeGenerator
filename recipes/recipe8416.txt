PORK LOIN AND SAUCE

Sauce:
1/3  c. lemon juice
1/3  c. water
2  Tbsp. catsup
1/4  c. soy sauce
3/4  c. brown sugar
1  tsp. ginger
1  tsp. minced garlic
1  tsp. lemon pepper

      The original recipe said to marinate the pork loin in this sauce.  I do this and also bake the loin in the sauce.  Bake in a 325 degrees; oven, covered, until the meat is no longer pink inside. Uncover the last 30 minutes of baking time.  Thicken the sauce in the pan with a little flour and water and dribble a little of this over slices of the roast pork.
