HOMEMADE SUMMER SAUSAGE


5  lb. ground beef (cheap brand, not lean ground)
5  Tbsp. curing salt (Morton "Tender Quick")
2  Tbsp. garlic powder (do not use garlic salt)
1  Tbsp. whole peppercorns
2  Tbsp. mustard seed or more to taste
1  Tbsp. cayenne pepper or more to taste
1  Tbsp. coarsely ground pepper (may use 2 Tbsp. and no whole peppercorns, if desired)
2  Tbsp. liquid smoke or more to taste

      Mix all ingredients thoroughly.  It's easier to mix, then knead it, as you would bread, to spread the seasonings throughout the meat.  Pack into a glass bowl, cover and refrigerate 24 hours. Remove from the refrigerator; mix well again and refrigerate for another 24 hours.  Repeat for a total of 4 days.
      On day 5, split sausage into 4 equal sections.  Form into rolls approximately 2-inches in diameter and 12 to 14-inches long.  Be sure to pack firmly to avoid gaps in sausage.  Preheat oven to 150 degrees;.  Place sausage rolls on broiler pan (on lowest shelf) in preheated oven and bake for 4 hours.  Turn rolls 180 degrees; and bake an additional 4 hours.  Remove from oven; cool, wrap in plastic or aluminum foil and refrigerate.  Sausage rolls may be frozen also.
      Since oven temperatures vary, you may need to turn it slightly higher if sausage does not appear to be cooking after 4 hours. Seasonings can be varied according to taste, but you must use 1 tablespoon curing salt for each pound of meat.
