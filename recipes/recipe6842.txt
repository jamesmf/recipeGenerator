MANICOTTI


12  oz. manicotti (1 box is plenty; I think it is 8 oz.)
12  oz. Mozzarella cheese
3/4  c. Ricotta cheese
3  eggs, lightly beaten
6  Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese
2  Tbsp. butter
2  c. tomato sauce
1/2  tsp. salt

      Combine Mozzarella cheese, Ricotta, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, eggs, butter and salt. Stuff into cooked shells. Pour a thin layer of tomato sauce in a shallow baking dish and put manicotti on top. Spoon rest of tomato sauce and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake at 375 degrees; for 20 minutes. Serves 6.
