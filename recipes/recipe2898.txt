DICKENS CHRISTMAS GREAT CAKE


2 1/4  c. sifted cake flour
1  tsp. baking powder
1/4  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. ground nutmeg
1/2  tsp. ground cinnamon
3/4  c. butter
1 1/4  c. sifted confectioners sugar
4  eggs
2  Tbsp. each light corn syrup and water
1/2  c. extra strength coffee
1/2  c. white raisins
1  c. seedless raisins
1  c. currants
1  c. chopped mixed candied fruit
1  c. finely slivered almonds

      Sift flour with baking powder, salt, nutmeg and cinnamon. Cream butter; gradually add sifted confectioners sugar and cream until light and fluffy.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition.  Then add flour mixture alternately with extra strength coffee, beginning and ending with flour and beating after each addition until smooth (batter will look curdled).  Fold in white raisins, seedless raisins, currants, mixed candied fruit and slivered almonds.  Spread in well-greased 9-inch tube pan.  Bake in moderate 350 degrees; oven 30 minutes.  Then sprinkle almonds on top of cake.  Bake 30 to 35 minutes longer.  Simmer corn syrup and water for 1 minute and brush over top of cake to hold almonds in place and to give a gloss.  Cool cake 15 minutes in pan, then turn out on rack to finish cooling.  Cake will slice best when chilled.  Eat at room temperature.
