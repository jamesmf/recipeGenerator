DION'S DIRTY RICE


2  lb. ground beef
3  c. water
2 - 3  Tbsp. of 100% pure black sesame oil
1  Tbsp. curry powder
1  box Zatarains Dirty Rice Mix
1  can mushrooms (stems and pieces)
1  Tbsp. soy sauce

	Brown ground beef in large pan with 1 cup water and sesame oil.  DO NOT DRAIN.  Add two cups of water to sauce pan and bring to boil.  Work ground beef so it is not clumping together.	Add rice mix with curry powder and return to boil.  Stir to mix ingredients.  (You can add regular rice and extra water to increase yield.) Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 - 25 minutes.  Add mushrooms and soy sauce while stirring.  Remove pan from heat and let stand for 5 minutes to complete absorption of water.  Fluff with large fork before serving.  Serve with cool side dishes such as salad and chilled avocado.  Consider a tart desert such as lemon pie.
