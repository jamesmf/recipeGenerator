      Bring to boiling the onion, carrots, garlic and water in a saucepan.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer about 10 minutes or until vegetables are tender (stir occasionally).  Do not drain.  Stir in milk, oat bran, parsley, salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Over medium-high heat, bring to boiling; cook and stir 2 minutes.  Remove from heat. Stir in cheese until melted.  Cool slightly.  In large mixer bowl beat egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Fold into vegetable mixture.  Pour into an ungreased 1 1/2-quart souffle dish and bake for 50 minutes in a 325 degrees; oven.  Top should be brown and a knife inserted near the center should come out clean.  Serve immediately. Makes 4 servings.
