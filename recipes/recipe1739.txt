      In large bowl, combine vinegar, Burgundy, onions, carrot, celery, allspice, cloves, salt and pepper.  Wipe meat with damp cloth.  Put meat in marinade.  Refrigerate, covered, for 3 days. Turn meat occasionally.  Remove meat; wipe dry with paper towels. Heat Dutch oven.  Add oil; heat.  Dredge meat in 2 tablespoons flour; in hot oil, brown very well on all sides.  Pour in marinade. Simmer, covered, 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until meat is tender.  Remove meat from Dutch oven.  Press liquid and vegetables through coarse sieve; skim off fat.  Measure 3 1/2 cups liquid (add water if necessary).  Return liquid to Dutch oven.  In small bowl, make paste of 1/3 cup cold water, remaining 2 tablespoons flour and the sugar.  Stir into liquid; bring to boiling, stirring.  Add the crushed gingersnaps.  Return meat to the Dutch oven; spoon gravy over it.  Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.  Remove meat to heated platter; pour on some gravy.  Serve, sliced thin, with more gravy.
