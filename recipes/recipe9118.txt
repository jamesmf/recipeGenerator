COUNTRY STYLE VENISON STEAK


1  c. flour
3  tsp. season-all
1/2  tsp. black pepper
1/3  tsp. m.s.g.
1/2  tsp. nutmeg
2  1/2 lbs. venison cut 1/2 inch thick
3/4  c. oil
2 1/4  Tbsp. chopped or minced dried onions
2  or 3 sliced carrots
1 1/2  tsp. beef flavored base
2 1/2  c. water

      In 2 1/2 c. water, soak dried onions and place beef base in to dissolve. Pound meat with tenderizer hammer until meat is thin in texture. Mix flour, season-all, pepper, m.s.g., and nutmeg. Coat meat on both sides with flour mixture and fry in hot oil in heavy skillet until browned on both sides. Place in baking pan. Put carrots over meat and put water with onions and base over that. Sprinkle rest of flour mixture over top and cover. (This will make your gravy.)  Cook in oven at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours, or until tender. Stir about 30 minutes into the cooking.
