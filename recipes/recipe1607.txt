ANGU
(Cornmeal Mush)  

1  Tbsp. oil
1  small onion, finely chopped
  salt and ground black pepper
2  cloves garlic, minced (tsp.)
2 to 3  c. cold water
1/2  c. fine (stone-ground) cornmeal

      Heat the oil in a large saucepan.  Cook the garlic and onion over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft but not brown. Add 2 cups water and bring to a rapid boil.
      Add the cornmeal in a thin stream through your fingers, stirring vigorously to prevent lumps.  The mixture should be the consistency of choux pastry or soft ice cream.  If too thick, make a hole in the angu with a wooden spoon and stir in a little cold water.  Reduce the heat to low and gently simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.  Correct the seasoning and serve at once.
      For a prettier presentation, the angu can be spooned into a thickly buttered tube pan and unmolded onto a platter.  Serves 6 to 8.
