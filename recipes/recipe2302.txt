CHICKEN FRIED STEAKS AND MILK GRAVY


4  (4 to 5 oz.) cube steaks
1/2  tsp. salt
1 1/2 to 1 3/4  tsp. pepper
1  c. all-purpose flour
2  eggs, lightly beaten
1/4  c. lard or vegetable oil
1  c. milk

      Season meat with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Mix flour with 1 teaspoon pepper in shallow plate.  Dredge each steak in flour.  Dip in beaten egg, then dredge in flour again. Heat lard or oil in large, heavy skillet until hot.  Fry steak 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the dredging flour into oil.  Cook over medium heat 1 minute, scraping up browned bits from bottom of skillet.  Stir in milk, a little at a time, until gravy is smooth.  Cook, stirring frequently, 3 to 4 minutes, until thickened and bubbly.  Add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon pepper and 1/4 teaspoon salt; gravy should be quite peppery.  Serve steaks smothered in gravy.
