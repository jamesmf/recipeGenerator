SWEET AND SOUR PICKLES


  small cucumbers
4  c. vinegar
1  c. water
1  c. sugar
3  Tbsp. salt
  chips of red pepper

      Wash cucumbers; pack in pint jars. Have a shallow pan of hot water ready. Turn jars upside down in pan. This allows steam to rise in jars and heat cucumbers. Do not leave too long. Heat, but do not boil, vinegar, water, sugar, and salt; remove jars and pour vinegar mixture over cucumbers. Let set for several weeks before opening jars to eat. Good with fish!
