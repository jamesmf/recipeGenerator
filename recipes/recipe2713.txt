1 1/2  doz. eggs, beaten (room temperature)

      Mix flour, cheese and salt.  Make a well.  Pour in yeast, eggs, Crisco and milk mixture.  Mix well.  Knead well.  Put Crisco on sides and bottom of loaf pans.  Place dough in each pan and punch down.  Let dough rise in pan 4 to 6 hours.  Smear egg yolks (2) on top of loaves.  Bake in 375 degrees; preheated oven for about 1/2 hour and check for doneness often after first 15 minutes.  Yield:  about 5 or 6 large loaves.  This recipe can be easily halved.
