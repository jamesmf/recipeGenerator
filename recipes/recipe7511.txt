CHICKEN WITH DROP DUMPLINGS


1  stewing chicken (4 to 5 lb.)
2  Tbsp. butter
2  Tbsp. olive oil
4  c. water
1  rib celery, diced
1/2  c. chopped onion
1  clove garlic, minced
1/2  tsp. dried thyme
1  tsp. dried parsley leaves
1  bay leaf
1  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. pepper
3  Tbsp. flour

      In Dutch oven or stock pot over medium heat, brown chicken on all sides in butter and olive oil mixture.  Add water, celery, onion, garlic, thyme, parsley, bay leaf, salt and pepper.  Cover and bring to a boil; lower heat and simmer for 2 to 3 hours, or until chicken is tender.  Remove chicken; remove meat from bones and return meat to pot.  Put flour in a cup; blend in enough cold water to make a smooth paste.  Stir flour paste into hot stew, stirring constantly until thickened.  Add dumpling batter and proceed according to directions.
Dumplings:
1  c. all-purpose flour
1  tsp. baking powder
1/2  tsp. poultry seasoning
1/2  tsp. salt
1  Tbsp. shortening
1  Tbsp. minced parsley
1  egg
3  Tbsp. milk

      Combine flour, baking powder, poultry seasoning and salt. Cut shortening into flour mixture; add 1 tablespoon minced parsley. In a separate bowl, whisk together egg and milk; add to dry mixture and stir with fork until well blended.  Drop dumplings by teaspoonfuls onto chicken pieces.  Cover and steam for 10 minutes, or until dumplings are fluffy and done inside.  Serves 4.
