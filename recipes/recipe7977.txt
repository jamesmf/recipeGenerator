HOT MADRAS BEEF CURRY


1 1/2 to 2  lb. round steak, cubed
1/2  c. butter
2  large onions, chopped
2  Tbsp. tomato paste
6  green chili peppers, chopped (jalapeno or other)
2  garlic pods, crushed
2  tsp. turmeric
4  tsp. chili powder
1  tsp. ground cumin
2  Tbsp. curry powder, more as desired
2  tsp. coriander
3  bouillon cubes
1  tsp. lemon juice
  salt and pepper to taste

      Heat the butter in large saucepan and fry the onions until golden brown.  Next add green chilies, turmeric, chili powder, cumin, garlic, coriander, curry and tomato paste.  Fry for 10 minutes, stirring constantly, making sure the masala does not stick to the bottom of the pan.  Add lemon, salt and pepper.  In large pan, brown the round steak in butter.  Add water and bouillon cubes.  Let simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.  Mix in the masala sauce.  Simmer for 2 or more hours, adding water as needed. Serve over rice or noodles.  This is a very spicy dish.  You can use more or less chilies to suit your personal taste.
