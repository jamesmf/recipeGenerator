CHICKEN KALYA


1  whole chicken, 8 pieces
1-1/2  tsp. salt
1  tsp. ginger paste
2  tsp. green chili paste
1  tsp. cumin powder
1/4  tsp. cardamom powder
2  pieces cinnamon, broken
  3-4 cloves
  4-5 cardamoms
2 small potatoes, cut into 8  slices each
4  small eggs, boiled
1-1/2  cups yogurt
1/2  cup fried onions, crushed
  6-8 strands saffron, crushed and soaked in 1/4 cup water.
8  whole, blanched almonds
10  raisins
4  dried plums (aalu bhukaray)
  Cooking oil

      Marinate chicken with salt, ginger/chili pastes, cumin powder, cardamom powder, cinnamon, cardamom and cloves.  Leave for 30 minutes.
      Deep-fry the sliced potatoes until golden.  Remove and place on paper towels.  Set aside.
       Heat about 1/2 cup oil in a pan and braise the chicken, turning frequently, until browned on all sides.  Sprinke with water while braising to prevent the chicken from sticking to the pan.
      Mix the yogurt and fried onions.  Pour this mixture over the chicken and keep sauting for 10 more minutes.  Cover and cook over low heat until chicken is more than half cooked.  Now add the saffron water, almonds, raisins, dried plums, fried potato slices, and boiled eggs, (don't cut the eggs until serving time).  Gently combine and coat all ingredients well.
       Cover and cook 10 additional minutes, until very fragrant and oill separates.
