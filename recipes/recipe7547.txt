CHEESY BREAKFAST CASSEROLE


2  pkg. Crescent Rolls
1  lb. Sausage
1  pkg. Cream Cheese
  Shredded cheddar cheese (optional)

      Place one pack of crescent rolls on bottom of pan pressing together for shell.  Saut√© sausage, drain, and pat off grease. Combine sausage w/cream cheese and spread over crescent rolls.  Top with the other package of crescent rolls pressing seams together. Bake for about 20 min. at 350 degrees;; then add all the cheddar cheese you want to cover top, and bake until cheese melts.  It's easier to use shredded cheddar.  Or you could half mixture with a smaller pan.
