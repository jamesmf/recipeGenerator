BAKED PEACH BUTTER


12  c. peaches, peeled, pitted and sliced
4  c. water
3  Tbsp. lemon juice
1/2  c. honey

      Place sliced peaches and water in an 8-quart stainless steel or enamel pot and cook over medium heat until peaches are soft, about 20 to 25 minutes.  Stir frequently to prevent peaches from sticking.  When fruit is tender, add lemon juice and honey and stir to combine.  Put the peach mixture through a food mill, blender or food processor and blend until smooth.  Pour and divide the puree into two shallow 9 x 13-inch baking pans.  Bake, uncovered, for 1 hour at 325 degrees;.  Continue baking, stirring every 15 or 20 minutes, until the butter is thick.  This will take approximately 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  The peach butter will be thick, fine textured and a rich reddish-amber color.
      Ladle it into hot, scalded half-pint jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace and seal.  Process for 10 minutes in a boiling-water bath.  Yield:  3 half-pints.
      This recipe is very good with homemade biscuits.
