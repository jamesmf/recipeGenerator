FRIENDSHIP BREAD

Do's And Don'ts:

      Do not use metal spoons or bowls for mixing.
      Do not refrigerate.
      If air forms in the bag, let it out.
      It is normal for the batter to thicken, bubble and ferment.
Starter:
1 (1/4 oz.)  pkg. dry active yeast
2 1/2  c. warm water
2  tsp. sugar (granulated)
2 1/2  c. all-purpose flour
1  c. oil*
1  c. sugar
1  tsp. vanilla
3  large eggs
1/2  tsp. salt
2  tsp. cinnamon
2  c. flour**
1/2  c. milk
1/2  tsp. baking soda***
1 1/2  tsp. baking powder***
1 large (5.1 oz.)  box vanilla pudding (instant)****
1  c. chopped nuts, 1 c. crushed pineapple or 1 c. chocolate chips (optional)

      Mix all ingredients thoroughly.  Pour into 2 large, well-greased and sugared loaf pans.  (Combine brown and white sugar with cinnamon to taste.)  You may use Pam, Baker's Joy or plain shortening to coat pan.  You may sprinkle some extra cinnamon-sugar mix on top, if desired.  Bake at 325 degrees; for 1 hour.
      *Crisco butter flavored liquid or plain oil.
      **Use plain or self-rising flour (self-rising will make larger loaves).
      ***Sift flour, soda and baking powder together to evenly distribute in batter.
      ****Two boxes of coconut cream pudding can be substituted.
