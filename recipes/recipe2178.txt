MEXICAN DIP


10 1/2  oz. can jalapeno bean dip
1  carton avocado dip
1  pkg. taco seasoning mix
1/2  c. sour cream
1/2  c. mayonnaise
3  green onions
1 small  can chopped ripe black olives
8  oz. shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1  medium tomato, chopped

      Use a round flat dish or large pie plate.  Spread layer of bean dip, then top with avocado dip.  Mix the taco seasoning mix with sour cream and mayonnaise; spread on top of avocado dip.  Top with chopped tomatoes, onions, olives and Cheddar cheese.  I save a little Cheddar cheese and add it as a topping, just for looks. This can be made a day ahead and refrigerated or refrigerate for a couple of hours and serve with Tostitos, Fritos, tortilla chips or tacos.
