HAM ROLLS


2  lbs. ground smoked ham
1  lb. ground pork
2  c. cracker crumbs
1  c. milk
2  eggs

 
Topping:
1/2  c. vinegar
1  c. brown sugar
2  tsp. horseradish
1/2  c. water
1  tsp. dry mustard
1  egg, beaten
2  Tbsp. milk
1/2  tsp. salt
  enough flour to make a stiff dough (about 1 cup)

      Let stand 20 minutes.
      Roll out thin on floured surface. Roll up loosely and slice 1/4 inch wide noodles.
      Unwind them and they can be used now or dried or freeze them.
       Note: To make a larger batch just increase the above ingredients. I usually use about 6 eggs so I will have enough to freeze.
      Hints on homemade noodle: Do not have broth boiling hard when you drop the noodles in. Always let them (rest the 20 minutes) that makes them more tender.
