EASY POTATO SOUP


1  bag Ore-IDA O'Brien (or any hashbrown type potato)
3  cans fat free chicken broth
1  pkg. fat-free Pioneer white gravy mix
1/2  c. water

      Cook the potatoes in chicken broth until soft, about 20 minutes.  Mix gravy mix with water and add to potatoes, stirring constantly.  Cook until desired consistency.  You can add a little shredded cheese on top when you serve it and it is YUMMY.
      If you are using the Weight Watchers Plan, this counts as 1 point per cup.  Additional points must be added if you add cheese.
