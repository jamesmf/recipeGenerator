SAUSAGE TWIRLS


1  pkg. any flavor Jimmy Dean pork sausage
2  c. biscuit mix
1/2  c. milk
1/4  c. butter or margarine, melted
1/4  c. red bell pepper, finely chopped (optional)
1/4  c. green onions, finely chopped (optional)

      Combine biscuit mix, milk and butter in large bowl until blended and refrigerate dough for 30 minutes.  Divide refrigerated dough into two portions and roll out each portion on wax paper to 1/8 inch thick rectangles, each about 10 x 7 inches.  On each of the rectangles, spread half the uncooked sausage over dough and top sausage with half the peppers and onions if desired.  Roll lengthwise into a log.  Place both logs, wrapped, in freezer until hard enough to cut easily, about one hour.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees;. Cut each log into 24 thin slices and place on non-stick baking sheets.  Bake 15 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove twirls from oven.  Reheat to serve.
