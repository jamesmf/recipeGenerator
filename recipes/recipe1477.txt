GRILLED CORN



  tender sweet corn
  butter
  salt and pepper

      Strip husks down to the end of the cob, but do not tear off. Remove silk.  If desired, soak in salted ice water to which 1/2 cup milk has been added for about 20 minutes; drain well.  Brush with softened butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Bring husks up around the corn.  Wrap each ear securely in a double thickness of aluminum foil.  Twist the ends well.  Barbecue on briquets 10 minutes, turning once.
