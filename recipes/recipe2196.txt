C.J.'S TANGY BREAD AND BUTTER PICKLES


5  qt. sliced cucumbers
6  medium onions
2  red and green bell peppers (I also use butter sweet pepper, jalapeno peppers and hot pepper), sliced (mix, depending on taste)
3  cloves garlic (optional; depending on other peppers used)
1/3  c. coarse medium salt
5  c. sugar
3 1/2  c. cider vinegar (1 qt. vinegar)
2  tsp. turmeric
2  tsp. celery seed
2  Tbsp. mustard seed

      Do not pare cucumbers; slice thin.  Add onions, peppers and garlic.  Add salt.  Cover with cracked ice.  Mix thoroughly.  Cover and let sit 3 hours.  (I use large roaster pan.)  Drain well. Combine remaining ingredients; bring to a boil.  Add cucumber mixture and stir well.  Heat to boiling.  Seal in hot sterilized jars.  Makes 5 quarts.  Be sure to pack cucumbers in jars.
