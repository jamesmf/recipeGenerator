1 (30 oz.) or 2 (16 oz.)  cans unsweetened pie filling
1  stick (1/2 c.) margarine
1  (2 layer) size white cake mix
1 1/2  c. granola

      Spread pie filling in a 2-quart dish (8 x 12-inches).  Place margarine in a 2 quart glass bottom bowl; microwave on High for 1 minute or until melted.  Stir in dry cake mix and granola.  Blend well.  Sprinkle this crumb mixture over pie filling.  Microwave on High 12 or 14 minutes, rotating halfway through cooking.  Top crumb mixture will become crisp upon standing.  Makes 8 servings.
      Serving suggestions:  Serve warm with a scoop of ice cream.  Or dish up and put yogurt on top while warm.
