MINESTRONE SOUP
(Yield: 6 Servings)  

3  Tbsp. olive oil
1  medium onion, chopped
3  cloves garlic, minced
1  Tbsp. dried Italian seasoning
1 (14.5 oz.)  can basil, oregano and garlic-flavored diced tomatoes
1  c. finely diced carrots
1  c. finely diced celery
1  c. finely diced zucchini
1  c. string beans, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2  c. shredded cabbage
1  c. peeled and finely diced potatoes
1  Tbsp. salt
1/2  tsp. freshly ground black pepper
8  c. water
1 (19 oz.)  can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed under cold water
1 1/2  c. ditalini (small, tube-shaped pasta)
1/3  c. freshly grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese

      Spray a 6-quart slow cooker with vegetable oil cooking spray. Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until soft, about 7 to 8 minutes. Add the Italian seasoning, tomatoes, carrots, celery and zucchini and cook for 5 minutes. Place the cooked vegetable mixture in the slow cooker. Add the string beans, cabbage, potatoes, salt, pepper and water. Stir to combine. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours. Add the kidney beans and pasta 20 minutes before serving. Cook until the pasta is tender. Stir in the cheese and serve immediately.
