CRAB VEGETABLE PASTRY


2  c. all-purpose flour
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  c. shortening
1/4  c. cold butter or margarine
1  egg yolk
1/3  c. cold water
2 (4 oz.)  cartons herbed semi-soft cheese spread*
1/2  c. finely chopped broccoli flowerets
1  c. finely shredded carrot
1 (6 oz.)  can crab meat, drained and flaked

      *Can substitute 8 ounce carton of soft-style cream cheese with chives and onion.
      Combine flour and salt in mixing bowl.  Cut in shortening. Make well in center.  Beat together egg yolk and water.  Add to flour mixture.  Form dough into a ball.  Divide in half.  Wrap in plastic wrap.  Chill in freezer for 20 minutes.
      Meanwhile, stir together crab meat, vegetables and cheese. Roll each portion to 1/8-inch.  Cut into 3-inch circles.  Spoon 1 rounded teaspoonful of filling in center of each.  Brush edges with water.  Fold rounds in half across filling.  Pinch edges to seal.  Cut slashes in sides of each, if desired.  Set sealed edge upright, press gently to slightly flatten the bottoms.  Place in ungreased 15 x 10 x 1-inch pan.  Bake at 375 degrees; for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Yield: 40.
      Can be frozen before baking, then bake when needed.
