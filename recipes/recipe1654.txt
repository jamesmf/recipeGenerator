FINNISH FRUIT CAKE


1  c. sugar
1  c. flour
  whipped cream
1  c. eggs
1  tsp. baking powder
  fruit of choice

      Beat eggs.  Gradually add the sugar, continuing to beat. Mixture should be beaten well and light in color.  Add the dry ingredients, taking care not to overbeat.  Pour into greased and floured round cake pans.  Bake at 325 degrees; for 30 minutes.  Cool, then slice layers in half.  Alternate layers of cake, fruit and whipping cream, as you would for a torte.
