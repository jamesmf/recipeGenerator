GREEN CHILE ENCHILADAS


1/3  c. butter
1/3  c. flour
2 1/2  c. half-and-half cream
1  c. diced green chiles
1/2  c. diced onion
1/8  tsp. cayenne pepper
4  c. Cheddar cheese, grated
4  c. Monterey Jack cheese, grated
  oil for frying
12  corn tortillas
2  c. sour cream

      Melt butter in saucepan and sprinkle in the flour.  When flour turns brown, add in the half-and-half, stirring slowly. Simmer, stirring regularly for 5 minutes.  Add the chiles, onion, and cayenne and simmer 10 minutes.  In a medium bowl mix most of the cheese (saving some for the top) and onion.  Heat oil in skillet and dip each tortilla into hot oil for 5 seconds; drain on paper towel.  Scoop cheese mixture on each tortilla, roll up and place in a 9-inch by 13-inch baking pan.  Top with green chile sauce and sprinkle with remaining cheese.  Bake at 400 degrees; until heated through and bubbly.  Garnish with sour cream.  Serves 6.
