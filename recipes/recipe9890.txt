STUFFED ZUCCHINI


6  medium zucchini
1  pkg. frozen spinach
2  c. grated cheese (I use Cheddar and Monterey Jack)
1  c. sour cream
1  stick butter, melted
1  medium onion, minced
2  Tbsp. sherry
1  tsp. paprika
  salt and pepper to taste

      Cut zucchini in half lengthwise and steam for 4 to 5 minutes (they should be firm). Scoop out seeds and place in greased baking pans.
       In bowl, combine all other ingredients. Mix well. Stuff zucchini with stuffing mixture and top with cooked and crumbled bacon (about 8 slices). Bake at 325 degrees; for 10 to 15 minutes.
      Great summertime veggie for barbecue parties with family and friends.
