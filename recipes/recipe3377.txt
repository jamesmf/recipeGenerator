POLENTA CRUSTED BRIE
(With Brandied Pear-Cranberry Salsa)  

1  round (8-oz.) Brie or Camembert cheese, chilled
2  Tbsp. all-purpose flour
  dash salt
1  egg
2  Tbsp. milk
1/2  c. yellow cornmeal

      Cut cheese into 8 wedges; set aside.  Stir together the flour and salt in a shallow dish.  Whisk together the egg and milk in a small mixing bowl.  Stir together cornmeal and cinnamon in another shallow dish.  Heat oil for deep frying to 365 degrees; in a heavy 3-quart saucepan or deep fryer.  Coat each piece of cheese with the flour mixture.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain.  Serve with Brandied Pear-Cranberry Salsa.  Makes 8 servings.
