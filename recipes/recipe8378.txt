BARBECUED "BABY BACK" SPARERIBS


1/2  c. catsup
1/2  c. chili sauce
2  Tbsp. soy sauce
4  Tbsp. brown sugar
2  Tbsp. vinegar
1  c. water
4  racks "baby back" ribs

      Combine catsup, chili sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan.  Stir well.  Cook over medium heat until it thickens.  This can be made up and refrigerated for several days.  Place ribs in oven at 250 degrees;.  I use cookie sheets covered with aluminum foil.  Cook at least 3 hours.  Remove to the grill. Coat with sauce, using a pastry brush, until both sides are browned.  Allow 30 minutes on the grill.  Try to buy your ribs on sale since they are expensive.  Bring them home and freeze them until you are ready to cook them.  This amount will feed 6 to 8 hungry people.
