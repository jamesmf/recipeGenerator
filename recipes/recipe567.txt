1  head cauliflower, cut in small flowerets
1  bunch broccoli, cut in small buds
1  large cucumber, sliced thin
4  large carrots, sliced thin
2  large sweet onions (make rings after slicing)
1  large green pepper (cut in rings)
1 (16 oz.)  bottle low calorie Italian Zesty dressing

      Marinate all cut up vegetables in dressing for  4 to 6 hours.
