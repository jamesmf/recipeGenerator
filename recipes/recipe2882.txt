EDIBLE HOLIDAY CENTERPIECE


30  large marshmallows
1  stick margarine
1  tsp. vanilla
2  tsp. green food coloring
3 1/2  c. corn flakes

      Combine margarine and marshmallows in top of double boiler. Put over hot water and heat until melted and well mixed.  If you do it over direct heat, keep heat low and stir and watch.  Add coloring and vanilla.  Mix well.  Pour over corn flakes or if pot is large, add corn flakes to warm mixture.  Drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper to form a 9-inch wreath.  Shape with hands and spoon or put waxed paper into 10-inch tube pan and use this to shape wreath. Decorate with red cherries.  If you plan to eat it soon, use maraschino cherries.  If you want to keep it a week or so, use candied cherries or silver dragees.  Stand a red candle (3-inches in diameter) in wreath.
