THREE-CHEESE BAKED ZITI


1  pkg. (16-oz.) ziti pasta
1  medium onion, finely chopped
1/2  c. butter
2  Tbsp. instant chicken bouillon
3  Tbsp. flour
6  c. milk
8  oz. Cheddar cheese, grated
8  oz. American cheese, grated
1/2  c. fresh Parmesan cheese, grated
1/2  c. bread crumbs

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Cook pasta according to package directions; rinse and drain.  In a large saucepan, melt butter, add onion, and saut√© until tender.  Add instant bouillon; stir until dissolved.  Stir in flour to make a roux.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes until browned, stirring constantly.  Slowly whisk in milk, until mixture is smooth.  Add all three cheeses; stir over low heat until completely melted.  Put cooked pasta into a 2-quart casserole dish and pour sauce over, gently tossing to coat evenly. Sprinkle with bread crumbs (and additional Parmesan cheese if desired).  Bake 30 to 40 minutes, or until browned and bubbly.
