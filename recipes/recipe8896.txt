SQUIRREL STEW


1/4  c. diced bacon
1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper
1  tsp. black pepper

2  cans diced tomatoes

      Cut up 3 squirrels in convenient-size pieces and place them in a large kettle; add 3 quarts of water. Bring to a boil slowly and simmer until the meat is tender (about 1 1/2 to 2 hours) or cook in a pressure cooker 30 to 45 minutes, depending on age of squirrel. REMOVE THE MEAT FROM THE BONES and put back in the water. Add bacon, cayenne, black pepper, salt, onion, tomatoes, tomato paste, potatoes and frozen vegetables. Cook for 1 hour. Then add corn and cook for another 10 minutes. Serve with corn bread. Serves 6.
