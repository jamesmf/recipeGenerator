GRILLED CARROTS


6  medium carrots
1  Tbsp. dehydrated onion flakes
1/2  tsp. garlic salt
  black pepper to taste
1/4  c. soy sauce
1/4  c. water
2  Tbsp. wine vinegar

      Place carrots on a large double layer of aluminum foil; fold up sides to form a container.  Sprinkle carrots with onion flakes, garlic salt and pepper.  Combine all remaining ingredients in a small jar or measuring cup; pour over carrots.  Wrap foil tightly around carrots to make a packet.  Marinate 2 hours, turning occasionally.  Remove carrots from foil; place on hinged grill or on a rack 4 inches from source of heat.  Grill 45 minutes or until carrots are tender.  Makes 6 servings.
