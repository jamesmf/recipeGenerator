CHICKEN CHOW MEIN


2  c. cubed chicken, uncooked
2  Tbsp. margarine
2  c. thinly sliced celery
1 1/2  c. sliced onion
1/8  tsp. pepper
2  c. chicken broth or bouillon
1 (15 oz.)  can mixed Chinese vegetables
1/2  can mushroom caps
1  Tbsp. cornstarch
3  Tbsp. soy sauce
1 (5 oz.)  can chow mein noodles

      Melt margarine in large skillet with a lid.  Add chicken and stir-fry until lightly browned.  Add celery and onion; stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add pepper and chicken broth; cover and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain Chinese vegetables; rinse and drain again.  Add to skillet; add undrained mushrooms and bring to a boil.  If more than 1 1/2 to 2 cups of liquid remain in skillet, cook over high heat to quickly evaporate excess liquid. In a cup, mix the cornstarch and soy sauce; stir until smooth. Add to skillet, stirring well to coat the vegetables and thicken liquid.  Add more water if sauce is too thick.  Serve over chow mein noodles.  Serves 4.
      Note: To reheat chow mein, add a little water and simmer over low heat until liquid is thickened again.
