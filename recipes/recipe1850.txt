BEAN SOUP


1  can garbanzo beans
4  medium potatoes, diced
1/2  green pepper, diced
1/2  small cabbage, shredded
1  roll pepperoni, sliced and quartered
2  c. diced ham
1/4  tsp. saffron or turmeric
3  diced garlic cloves
3  bay leaves
  salt
  pepper

      Put potatoes in large pot with enough water to cover.  Cook until almost done.  In meantime, cut up all other ingredients. Add rest and simmer for about 20 minutes.  Don't drain potatoes; may need to add water.  This is great for crock-pot.  Just put all ingredients in crock-pot with water to cover well.  Cook on low all day.
