MEATBALLS


1/2  lb. ground beef
1/2  lb. sausage
1  c. dry bread crumbs
1  onion, minced
3  eggs, beaten
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. pepper
1/2  tsp. thyme leaves
1/2  tsp. paprika
3  Tbsp. olive oil

      Combine all ingredients; mix well.  Roll into 1 inch balls. Cook in pan on medium heat until done; drain on paper towels. These are good alone or in your favorite spaghetti sauce.  Also, very good in brown gravy.
