1  c. white vinegar
1/2  c. salt
1  dried red pepper
2 thick  slices yellow onion

      You will need 1 (1-gallon) glass jar (a "sun-tea" glass beverage server is ideal too!).
      Take the glass jar and layer the following inside: 1/2 bunch of washed and drained dill. Add the whole cucumbers, garlic, pepper and onion slices. Then remaining dill.
      Brine: Bring 16 cups of water, the vinegar and salt to a boil for 1 minute. Pour boiling mixture over the pickles and seal the jar immediately.
      Cool jar, then refrigerate for 10 days. (Turn the jar occasionally during the 10 day period.)
