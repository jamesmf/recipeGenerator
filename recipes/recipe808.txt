TURKEY-VEGETABLE SOUP


1  chopped onion
2  Tbsp. butter or margarine
2  c. water
2  chicken bouillon cubes
2  c. diced, cooked turkey
1/2  c. celery tops and pieces
1  c. diced carrots
2 1/2  c. milk
2  Tbsp. flour
1  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. black pepper

      Cook onion in butter until tender.  Add water, bouillon cubes, turkey and vegetables.  Boil gently, covered, until vegetables are tender.  Stir a little milk into the flour until mixture is smooth. Add remaining milk, salt and pepper.  Add to soup.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, to prevent sticking until soup is slightly thickened.
