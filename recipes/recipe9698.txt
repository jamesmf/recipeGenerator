LASAGNA ROLL-UPS


12  lasagna noodles
1 (10 oz.)  pkg. frozen chopped broccoli
2  green onions, minced
2  c. 1% cottage cheese
1/4  c. Parmesan cheese
1/2  tsp. salt
1  egg
2  c. prepared spaghetti sauce
1  c. grated part-skim Mozzarella

      Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain, rinse and set aside. Put broccoli in a microwave-safe dish; cover with plastic and cook for 3 minutes. Add the minced onion and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Drain well and squeeze the extra moisture out with the back of a spoon.
      Combine the cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, salt and egg in a medium sized mixing bowl. Stir in the broccoli and green onions. Preheat oven to 350 degrees;. Place the cooked noodles on wax paper. Evenly spread some cheese and broccoli mixture on each noodle. Roll up each noodle. Using a 9 x 13-inch baking dish, spoon in 2/3 of the spaghetti sauce. Arrange the rolled noodles with their seams down on the sauce. Top with remaining sauce and cover with foil. Bake for 25 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle with Mozzarella and continue baking until the cheese melts (10 minutes). Yields 6 servings.
