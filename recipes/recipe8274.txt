SIRLOIN STEAK WITH MOLASSES RUB


1  c. brown sugar, packed
2  Tbsp. molasses
2  tsp. paprika
2  tsp. dried thyme
1 1/2  tsp. kosher salt
1 1/2  tsp. black pepper
1  tsp. garlic powder
6  Tbsp. butter (unsalted; not margarine)
2  lb. sirloin steaks

	To prepare the rub, combine all ingredients, except steaks, in the bowl of a food processor and process until the mixture is well blended. This rub can be prepared in advance and stored in an airtight container until ready to use. Using your hands, completely cover the steaks with the rub. Place them on a plate; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours. Remove steaks from the refrigerator and allow to return to room temperature while preparing the grill. Grill steaks for 6 to 8 minutes per side for medium-rare.
