EASTER EGG DYE


1/4  tsp. of each food color
3/4  c. boiling water (for each color)
1  Tbsp. vinegar (for each color)
  hard-boiled eggs
  vegetable oil (optional)

      For each color desired for dyeing, measure food color, water and vinegar into a small bowl; mix well with a spoon.  Leave the spoon in the bowl, so the colors don't get mixed together from one bowl to another.
      Gently place an egg into dye, turning to color evenly.  Dry on cooling rack.  For a "marbled" look, add 1 teaspoon oil to a bowl of color; stir and dip egg briefly.
