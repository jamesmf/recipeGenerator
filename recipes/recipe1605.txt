BRAZILIAN RICE


4  Tbsp. vegetable oil
1  yellow onion, finely chopped
3  cloves garlic, crushed
3  c. white long grain rice, washed and drained
4  c. boiling water
1  bay leaf
2  medium tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped
1/2  Tbsp. salt

      In a 4-quart pot, heat the oil over the medium-high heat and stir-fry the onion and garlic until golden.  Pour in the rice and stir for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the water, bay leaf, tomatoes and salt.
      Return to a boil and continue stirring until almost all the water is evaporated, about 5 minutes.  Cover the pot and reduce the temperature.  Simmer for 20 minutes or until the rice is cooked. Serves 4 to 6.
