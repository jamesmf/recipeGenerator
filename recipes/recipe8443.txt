SWEET "N" SOUR MEATBALLS


2  lbs. hamburger
8  oz. Heinz ketchup
2 1/2  c. sugar
2  c. vinegar
1  onion
1  green pepper

      Roll your hamburger into balls.  Chop onions and green peppers. Fry onions, peppers and meatballs together.  While this is frying, make a sauce out of ketchup, sugar and vinegar in a skillet.  Drain the grease off meatballs and add to sauce.  Let it simmer for an hour and then you have yourself Sweet "N" Sour meatballs.
