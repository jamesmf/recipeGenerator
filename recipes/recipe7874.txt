BUTTER & HERB CHICKEN


1  whole chicken with skin
6  Tbsp. butter, melted
1  Tbsp. each of garlic and ginger paste
  Juice of 1 large lemon
2  Tbsp. cajun spice
1  tsp. each, onion salt and onion powder
1  tsp. celery salt
1  tsp. black pepper powder
1/8  cup chopped fresh curly (or flat) parsley
1  long rib of celery, thinly sliced
1  Tbsp. fresh or dried marjoram
1/2  Tbsp. powdered sage
1/2  Tbsp. crushed rosemary
1  Tbsp. fresh chopped basil (dry can be used)
1/2  Tbsp. fresh or dried thyme
1  tsp. dried oregano
1/2  Tbsp. dried mint leaves
  Dash of crushed red pepper
  Salt (optional)

      Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees;F.  Wash chicken and dry with paper towels.  If needed, trim excess fat.  Thoroughly pierce chicken all over, and add a few deeper slashes for good measure.  Place chicken in baking dish.
      In a medium-sized bowl, melt butter and add all remaining ingredients.  Mix well and rub the butter-herb mixture thoroughly into chicken, making sure to get the mixture into the slashes and inside the cavity of the chicken.  Make the rubbing process quick, since the butter will start to congeal quickly on the cold chicken.
      Place the chicken (uncovered) breast side up and bake for 35 minutes, until nicely browned. Turn chicken and bake another 25-30 minutes until the skin is nicely roasted on top.  If chicken seems to be drying out too quickly, cover tightly with foil during the last 15-20 minutes of baking. Serve hot with fresh garlic bread and mashed potatoes.
