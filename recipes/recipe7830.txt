ROY'S MEAT LOAF


1  c. tomato sauce
1/2  Tbsp. barbecue sauce
1  Tbsp. sugar
1 1/2  lb. ground sirloin (10 percent fat)
6  Tbsp. flour
1/4  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. onion powder
1/4  tsp. black pepper
  Dash garlic powder

      Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine the tomato sauce, barbecue sauce and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat the mixture until it begins to bubble, stirring often, then remove it from heat.  In a large bowl, add all but 2 tablespoons of the tomato sauce mixture to the meat.  Use a large wooden spoon or your hands to work the sauce into the meat until it is very well combined.  Combine the remaining ingredients (flour, salt, onion powder, black pepper and garlic powder) with the ground sirloin. Use the wooden spoon or your hands to work the spices and flour into the meat.  Load the meat into a loaf pan, preferably a meat loaf pan (with the two sections) that allows the fat to drain.  If you don't have one, a regular loaf pan will work.  Wrap foil over the pan and place it into the oven for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, take the meat loaf from the oven, remove the foil and - if you are not using a meat loaf pan - drain the fat. Using a knife, slice the meat loaf all the way through into 8 slices while it is still in the pan.  This will help to cook the center of the meat loaf.  Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of sauce over the top of the meat loaf in a stream down the center. Don't spread the sauce.  Place the meat loaf back into the oven, uncovered for 25 to 30 minutes or until it is done.  Remove and allow it to cool for a few minutes before serving.
