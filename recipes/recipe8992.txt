CHEESEBURGER BITES


1  egg yolk, beaten
1/2  lb. lean ground beef
2  Tbsp. grated onion
1/2  tsp. salt
  dash of pepper
6  slices bread
24  cubes Cheddar cheese (1/2-inch cubes)

      In a bowl, combine egg yolk, ground beef, onion, salt and pepper. Shape mixture by teaspoonfuls into 24 balls. Remove crusts from bread. Roll flat and cut into 1 1/2-inch rounds. Place meatballs on bread rounds. Make a depression in each ball and fill with a cube of cheese, making sure bread is covered with meat mixture. Place on baking sheet. Broil in preheated oven about 6-inches from heat for 3 to 5 minutes or until no pink remains. Garnish with ketchup, mustard, sliced green onions or sliced dill pickles, if desired.
