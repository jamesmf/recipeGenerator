ARTICHOKE BACON SPREAD


1  medium bell pepper, seeded, chopped (about 1 c.)
3  cloves garlic, chopped
1  Tbsp. Butter
2  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
1  tsp. celery salt
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. black pepper
2  c. mayonnaise
2 - 14  oz. cans artichoke hearts (6 - 8 count), drained, coarsely chopped
1/2  c. sliced green onion
2  Tbsp. Jalapeno peppers, chopped (fresh or pickled)
1/2  c. sour cream
8  oz. grated Parmesan cheese (about 2 c.)
1 - 4  oz. pkg. (1 c.) sliced almonds
1 1/2  lb. bacon, crisply fried, coarsely broken (reserve 2 Tbsp. for garnish)

      Saut√© bell pepper and garlic in butter; set aside.  Measure all other ingredients except sliced almonds and bacon in large mixing bowl; add bell pepper and garlic, mix well.  Fold in sliced almonds and bacon.
       Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Spray bottom and sides of baking dish with cooking spray.  Pour artichoke mixture into prepared dish. Sprinkle topping over mixture in the order given.  Bake until bubbly and top is light golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Serve warm with tortilla chips, pita bread wedges, or crackers (Ritz crackers are my favorite).
       Note:  This is a spread;  it has too much bulk to dip.  This is a great side dish at holiday meals.  Can be prepared several days ahead before baking.  DO NOT FREEZE.
Topping:
4  oz. grated cheddar cheese
2  Tbsp. sliced Almonds
2  Tbsp. sliced green onion blades
