BAKED FISH



2  fish fillets (flounder)
2  tsp. olive oil
2  tsp. crushed fresh garlic
1  Tbsp. chopped parsley
1  Tbsp. chopped basil or any herb you like
  salt
  pepper

      Rinse fish and dry with paper towel. Brush fish with olive oil. Salt and pepper both sides of the fish and place on a baking dish. Rub the top of the fish with the fresh garlic and sprinkle the fish with herbs. Bake at 350 degrees; for 20 minutes. Serve with your favorite side dishes. (I like to slice a lime and squeeze on my fish.) Makes 2 servings.
