WHITE CHRISTMAS CHIFFON PIE


1 1/2  c. milk
4  Tbsp. flour
1  c. sugar
1/4  c. cold water
1/2  c. heavy cream
3  large egg whites
1 1/2  c. freshly shredded coconut
1  envelope unflavored gelatin
3/4  tsp. vanilla
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. almond extract
1/4  tsp. cream of tartar
2  baked pie shells

      Soften gelatin in cold water.  Mix together in a saucepan the milk, flour and sugar; cook to slightly thicken and dissolve the gelatin in that.  Cool.  Then whip the cream.  Beat the egg whites until stiff and add the cream of tartar.  To the gelatin mixture, fold in the whipped cream and the egg whites.  Add the vanilla and almond extract.  Then fold in the coconut.  Spoon into the pie shells and chill in the refrigerator.
