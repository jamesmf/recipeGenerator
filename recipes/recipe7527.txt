CHILE-CHEESE CASSEROLE


1/4  c. butter
1  c. onion, chopped
4  c. cooked rice
2  c. sour cream
1  c. small-curd cottage cheese
1  Tbsp. dried parsley
1/2  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. pepper
1 1/2  c. whole chiles, split open
2  c. shredded Cheddar cheese

      Preheat oven to 375 degrees;.  Saut√© the onions in butter until tender.  Remove from heat, then stir in the rice, sour cream, cottage cheese, parsley, salt and pepper, mixing well.  Grease a 9-inch square pan.  Layer in 1/2 the rice mixture, followed by half of the chiles and half of the Cheddar cheese.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients to form a second layer.  Cover and bake for 30 minutes or until hot and bubbly.  Uncover during the last 10 minutes to allow the cheese to brown.
