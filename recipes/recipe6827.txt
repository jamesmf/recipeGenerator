BEEFY HASH BROWN PIZZA


5  c. frozen shredded hash brown potatoes, thawed
1 (10 3/4 oz.)  can Cheddar cheese soup (undiluted)
1  egg, lightly beaten
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
2  lb. ground beef
1  medium onion, chopped
1 (4 oz.)  can mushroom stems and pieces, drained
1  can pizza sauce
4  c. (16 oz.) shredded pizza cheese, divided

      In a bowl, combine the potatoes, soup, egg, salt and pepper. Spread mixture into a greased 15 x 10-inch baking pan. Bake at 400 degrees; for 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly browned.
      Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook the beef, onion and mushrooms until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in pizza sauce; keep warm. Sprinkle 2 cups cheese over warm crust. Spread meat mixture over the top; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake 5 to 10 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
      This is a different but good and tasty meal and it really doesn't take long to make.
