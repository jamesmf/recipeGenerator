GENERAL TSAO'S CHICKEN

Chicken:
1  lb. chicken, (legs and/or boneless) cut into 1-inch cubes
1  large egg, beaten
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. white pepper
2  tsp. soy sauce
3  Tbsp. cornstarch

 
Sauce:
3  Tbsp. dark soy sauce
1-1/2  tsp. minced garlic
1  Tbsp. minced, fresh ginger
2  Tbsp. hoisin sauce
3  tsp. brown sugar
1-1/2  tsp. sesame or peanut oil
3  tsp. rice vinegar
1/2  cup chicken broth
  Pinch monosodium glutamate
1  Tbsp. freshly grated orange peel
  Oil for deep frying
  Cornstarch, for dusting
8  small, dried red chilli peppers
1/4  cup finely sliced green onions

      In a bowl, mix together the egg, salt, pepper, soy sauce, and cornstarch.  Add the chicken cubes, mix to coat.  Marinate 20 minutes.
       In another bowl, combine all the sauce ingredients and set aside for later use.
      Heat oil for deep-frying in a wok to 350 degrees;F.  With tongs, remove the chicken cubes individually, dust with cornstarch, and place in hot oil. Deep fry in small quantities for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes, until chicken is browned and crisp.  Drain on paper towels.
      Turn off heat.  Remove all but 2 Tbsp. oil from the wok.
      Heat the wok over high heat for 20 seconds.  When a wisp of white smoke appears, add the dried red chillies and stir for 15 seconds.  Break a few of them for spicier flavor.  Add the scallions and stir for 30 seconds.  Add the chicken and cook while stirring for 1 minute.
      Stir the sauce mixture and pour it into the wok.  Stir well; cook over medium-low heat until chicken  cubes are completely coated with the sauce and the sauce thickens a bit, about 2 minutes.
      Remove from heat and serve hot with steaming white rice.
