ROASTED RED PEPPER AND CORN CHOWDER


1  large red pepper, roasted and finely chopped*
4  c. frozen corn kernels, thawed
1  oz. Canadian bacon, finely minced
2  tsp. olive oil
2  c. finely chopped leeks (about 3 leeks)
4  tsp. flour
6  c. chicken broth
2  large potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1  tsp. dill weed (add more for a more intense dill flavor)
1  c. cream or half and half
  freshly ground pepper
  pinch of cayenne

      *Rub red pepper with olive oil and roast whole in 400 degrees; oven for about 40 minutes, turning to ensure that all skin becomes blackened.  When black, place in paper bag and let cool.  When cool, skin peels off easily.  Remove seeds and membranes and finely chop.
      In blender or food processor, puree 2 cups corn; set aside. In medium stockpot, saut√© the bacon until browned.  Add the oil and leeks and cover; sweat until softened, about 8 minutes.  Stir in flour and cook about 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low and add broth, potatoes, dill and red pepper.  Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes.  Stir in corn puree and remaining 2 cups of kernels.  Whisk in cream and simmer until heated through, but do not boil.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve with a dollop of sour cream, seasoned with a little dill weed.
