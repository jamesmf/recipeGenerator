SWEET 'N' SOUR POT ROAST


1  tsp. garlic salt
1/2  tsp. ground mustard
1/4  tsp. pepper
1  boneless beef chuck roast (4 1/2 to 5 lb.)
2  Tbsp. vegetable oil
2  c. water
1/2  c. soy sauce
2  Tbsp. white vinegar
2  Tbsp. honey
1  Tbsp. celery seed
1 1/2  tsp. ground ginger or 2 Tbsp. minced, fresh ginger root
6  Tbsp. cornstarch
1/2  c. cold water
  hot, cooked brown rice (optional)

      Combine garlic salt, mustard and pepper; rub over entire roast. In a Dutch oven, brown roast on all sides in oil over medium-high heat; drain. Combine the water, soy sauce, vinegar, honey, celery seed and ginger; pour over roast. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 3 to 3 1/2 hours or until meat is tender. Remove roast from pan and keep warm.
      Pour pan drippings and loosened brown bits into a measuring cup.  Skim fat, reserving drippings.  Add enough water, if needed, to measure 5 cups.  Return to Dutch oven.  Combine cornstarch and cold water until smooth; gradually add to drippings.  Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.  Slice roast; serve with gravy and brown rice, if desired.  Yield:  12 to 16 servings.
