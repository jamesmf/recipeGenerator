Remarks:

      When refrigerated rice is used, add 1/4 cup stock in step 2 to soften rice and cook it a little longer.
      When fresh rice is used, it may be a bit too sticky. Spread out and let dry awhile before using for this dish.
      After rice is added, use only medium or medium-low heat to stir-fry to avoid burning and sticking of rice. Stir rice continuously.
      Any of the above meats and vegetables can be substituted or simply omitted. Shrimp is good!
      This dish can be prepared ahead of time and reheated when desired.
      Six cups of rice is a lot! You may end up eating rice for a week!
