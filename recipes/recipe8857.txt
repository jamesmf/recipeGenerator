CARBONARA


1/2  lb. bacon, cut in small pieces
1/4  c. extra virgin olive oil
2  Tbsp. kosher salt or 1 Tbsp. regular salt
1  lb. pasta (fettuccine or spaghetti)
3  eggs
1  c. Parmesan cheese
3  small garlic cloves
  salt and pepper to taste

      Brown bacon in oil 7 to 8 minutes. Cover to keep warm. Add salted water and cook pasta as directed. Stir often. (Save 1/3 cup pasta water for additional moisture if needed.) Beat eggs. Add to cheese and add garlic. Combine drained pasta, egg/cheese mixture, bacon, salt and pepper. The warm bacon and pasta will cook the egg mixture.
