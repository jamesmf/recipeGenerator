      Cut a lengthwise slit down the center of each tenderloin to within 1/2-inch of bottom; open tenderloins so they lie flat. Cover with plastic wrap; pound to flatten to 3/4-inch thickness. Remove plastic wrap.  In a large, resealable, plastic bag, combine the oil, soy sauce and lemon juice.  Add tenderloins.  Seal bag and turn to coat.  Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
       In a skillet, saut√© celery and onion in butter until tender. Remove from the heat. Stir in bread crumbs, apple, raisins, jelly, salt,  poultry seasoning, pepper and rosemary. Remove tenderloins from marinade. Discard marinade. Spread stuffing down the center of 1 tenderloin. Top with the second tenderloin. Tie several times with kitchen string and secure ends with toothpicks. Arrange bacon over the top.
       Place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees; for 1 hour or until meat thermometer reads 160 degrees;. Broil 4 to 6-inches from the heat for 4 to 5 minutes or until bacon is browned and crisp. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing. Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
