STIR-FRY BEEF WITH BROCCOLI


14  oz. flank steak
4  tsp. soy sauce
2  garlic cloves, finely chopped
1/4  c. beef broth
1  head broccoli, separated into stalks and flowerets
2  carrots, pared and cut into thin strips and sliced thinly
1  large onion, cut into eighths

      Cut steak into thin strips; combine with soy sauce, garlic and 2 tablespoons of broth.  Marinate while preparing the vegetables.  Cut and wash broccoli flowerets. I don't use the large stalk part of the broccoli but if you do use them, you need to peel them and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices.  Wash, peel and cut carrots into strips or slice thinly crosswise.  Cut onion.
      Heat  a little oil in a skillet or wok over medium heat.  Add beef with soy mixture; stir-fry 3 to 5 minutes until beef is almost cooked through.  Remove with slotted spoon to platter, leaving any liquid in the pan.  Add broccoli, carrot and onion. Add remaining broth. Cover; cook about 5 minutes.  Add beef; stir-fry 2 to 3 minutes or until cooked through. Serve. Serves 4.
