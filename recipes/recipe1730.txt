HAREESAH
(Wheat Stew)  

3  lb. chuck roast with bones
4  c. expanded wheat (whole grain, i.e., not crushed)
2  tsp. salt
  water
3  Tbsp. hot oil
1/2  c. sugar
2  tsp. cinnamon

      In a 12-quart saucepan, place the chuck roast, wheat, salt and enough water to cover.  Bring to a boil on high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and let cook with frequent stirring until all the water is absorbed and the meat comes off the bones.  (Be careful not to overdry it for it may char.)  Remove wheat to a large plate and let cool.  Remove bones from meat and set aside.  In a blender, puree the wheat with the addition of a little water.  Place the pureed wheat back into the large plate.  In the same blender, chop the meat.  Mix the meat and wheat and return to the saucepan.  Add about 2 cups water.
      Bring to a boil on high heat, then reduce heat to low.  Cook with frequent stirring for 1 hour or until thick.  Stir often so it does not stick to bottom of pot.  When done, the stew should be smooth like porridge; if not, add more water and let cook a little longer.
      To serve:  Spoon into a large deep dish.  Pour hot oil over it, then sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.
