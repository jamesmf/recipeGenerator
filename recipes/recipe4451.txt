BEEF OR PORK SAUCE


5  oz. Worcestershire sauce
5  oz. A.1.
1  stick butter
1/2  c. brown sugar
  juice of 1 lemon

      Add all ingredients.  Bring to a boil.  Pour over uncooked meat and let set (as little as 30 minutes or as long as all day). Use remaining sauce with meat after it's cooked!  I recommend using this sauce with pork tenderloin.
