BUTCH'S SAUSAGE DIP


1  lb of ground sausage
1  pkg. cream cheese

      Brown the sausage, drain and pat dry, then add the onion, Rotel tomatoes, black olives and simmer till all the juice is gone, also add a little Tabasco or Crystal hot sauce (to taste), then add cream cheese (cubed) until melted, and serve with corn chips, scoops, crackers, etc.  The spicier the sausage and tomatoes, the spicier the dip.
