SPANISH CASSEROLE


2  lb. lean ground meat
1  large onion, chopped
  salt to taste
1 (10 oz.)  can enchilada sauce (I use hot)
2 (10 3/4 oz.)  cans cream of mushroom soup
1 (10 3/4 oz.)  can water
1 small (4 oz.)  can green chilies, chopped
1 (12 count)  pkg. corn tortillas
3/4 to 1  lb. grated Cheddar cheese

      Brown beef, onion and salt. Add enchilada sauce and water mixed with soup and green chilies. Simmer for 30 minutes. In a large 13 x 9-inch casserole or pan, grease and line bottom with 6 tortillas. Cover with half of the meat mixture. Sprinkle half of the grated cheese on top. Continue second layer, topping with remaining cheese. Bake in oven at 350 degrees; for 45 minutes to 1 hour until mixture is bubbly.
      Optional: May dot with jalapeno slices on top of cheese. Cover and refrigerate overnight (not mandatory).
