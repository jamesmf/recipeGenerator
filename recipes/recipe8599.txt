CRESCENT BAKE

16  oz. can tomato sauce
2  pkgs. refrigerator crescent rolls

      Brown burger in frying pan, then add the sloppy joe mix, tomato sauce, oregano, salt and pepper.  Simmer for 10 min.  Cover the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch pan with 1 pkg. of the crescent rolls.  Put meat mixture over the top.  Sprinkle with the 2 cheeses.  Top this with the other package of crescent rolls (I roll mine between 2 pieces of waxed paper).  Bake at 350 degrees for 25 min. uncovered.
