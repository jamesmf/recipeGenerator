STEAK CARBONADE


  New York strip or sirloin steaks for outdoor grilling
  lemon pepper
  beer

      Place steaks in flat glass baking pans and shake on layer of lemon pepper.  Press into steak.  Cover with beer (Pilsner) or for a heavier flavor, a dark beer;  just enough to cover steaks. Marinate for 3 or 4 hours.  Grill on outdoor grill to your taste. Do not salt until served.
      Meat tenderizer may be used, but the beer is a tenderizer.
