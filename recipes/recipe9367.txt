TATER TOT CASSEROLE


1  lb. hamburger meat
1/2 to 3/4  lb. Velveeta cheese
1 10 3/4  oz. can cream of mushroom soup
1 32  oz. bag Oreida Tater Tots, onion flavor optional

      Ingredients will be layered into an 8 X 9 inch square casserole dish.  Season hamburger meat as desired and spread on the bottom of your casserole dish.  Pour mushroom soup over hamburger and spread evenly.  Cut cheese into slices approximately 1/4 inch thick and place each slice neatly over the soup until it is all covered.  Take approximately 3/4 bag of tater tots and layer over cheese.  Bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees and enjoy.
