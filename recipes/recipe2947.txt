HELEN'S HUNGARIAN CHEESE


5  (8 oz.) cream cheese, softened
1 (8 oz.)  jar Cheez Whiz
1  stick unsalted butter, softened
1  Tbsp. mustard
2  Tbsp. caraway seeds
  a lot of chives! (1 to 1 1/2 c.)

      Cream the cream cheese, Cheez Whiz and butter.  Then add the mustard, caraway seeds and chives.  Mix well.  Refrigerate overnight or the seeds will be hard and taste like wood chips. Spread on buffet style rye bread, rye crisps or crackers.  Best way is spread on real crusty Jewish rye bread.  If you're lucky enough to live in parts of the country where you can get it!!  This recipe makes A LOT!!!  You can halve the recipe and still have enough for a small party.  Enjoy!
