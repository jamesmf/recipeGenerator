ZWIEBEL KUCHEN
(Onion Pie)  
Crust:
1  c. flour
1  tsp. salt
1/3  c. lard or shortening
1/3  c. cold water

      Sift flour and salt together; cut in shortening.  Mix in water with swift strokes.  Roll out dough and put into an 8 or 9-inch pie pan.
Filling:
  about 5 sweet onions
1  c. water
1  Tbsp. flour
  salt and pepper
1  or 2 eggs
1  c. milk

      Peel and slice about 5 sweet onions.  Parboil for approximately 5 minutes in water.  Pour off excess water and place onions into the pie pan, on top of dough.  Sprinkle with flour, salt and pepper.  Break 1 or 2 eggs into a bowl; add to it the milk and stir well.  Pour over onions.  Bake for 45 minutes in 400 degrees; oven.  Serve warm as a vegetable.
      This same recipe can be used as a spinach pie.  Cook spinach and chop.  Add to it a small chopped onion, some salt, pepper and flour, sprinkled over it and then the egg custard.  Bake the same as before.  These recipes were predecessors to the modern quiche. This is an old recipe brought over from Switzerland.  Years ago, this was made just as the new onions from the garden were ready to use.  The fresher and sweeter the onions, the better the pie.
