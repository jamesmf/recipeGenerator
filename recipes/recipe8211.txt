STUFFED GREEN PEPPERS


6  large green peppers
1  lb. ground beef
1/2  c. chopped onions
1 (16 oz.)  can tomatoes, cut up
1/2  c. long grain rice
1/2  c. water
1  tsp. salt
1  tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1  c. shredded American cheese (4 oz.)

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;. Cut tops from green peppers; discard seeds and membranes. Chop enough of the tops to make 1/4 cup; set aside. Cook the whole peppers, uncovered, in boiling water for 5 minutes; invert to drain well. Sprinkle insides of peppers lightly with salt.
       In a skillet, cook ground beef, onion and the 1/4 cup chopped green pepper until meat is browned and vegetables are tender. Drain off excess fat. Add undrained tomatoes, uncooked rice, water, salt, Worcestershire sauce and dash of pepper. Bring to boiling, reduce heat, cover and simmer 15 to 18 minutes or until rice is tender. Stir in cheese. Stuff peppers with meat mixture. Place in a 10 x 6 x 2-inch baking dish. Bake, covered, in a 350 degrees; oven for 30 to 35 minutes. Serves 6.
