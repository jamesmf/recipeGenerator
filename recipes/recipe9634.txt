STEW


3 to 4  lb. Boston Butt
3 to 4  lb. Chuck Roast
1  Large Fryer
5  lb. Diced Potatoes (can use frozen hash browns, thawed)
3  lb. Onions, diced (can use frozen, thawed)
3 Large  Cans Tomatoes (put in blender)
6  Cans White Cream Style Corn
1  Bottle Durkees Sandwich Sauce
1 Large  Bottle Ketchup
  Salt, Pepper, Hot Sauce to taste

      Cook all meat till tender, saving the broth. Take meat off the bone and remove all fat & skin. Pull apart meat. In a large pot put all meat and add enough broth to cover,  plus about 1 quart. Add tomatoes and onions and bring to a boil; add potatoes, Durkees, hot sauce, and ketchup. Reduce heat to simmer and cook for 2 hours, stirring often until most of the liquid is cooked out. Add corn last and cook for 15 minutes, stirring all the time it cooks so it won't stick. This is supposed to be thick, but if it is too thick for you, just add a little more broth.
