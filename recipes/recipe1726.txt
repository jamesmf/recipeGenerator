BAKLAVA


1 1/2  lb. chopped walnuts
1/2  c. sugar
1/2  tsp. ground cardamom
1  lb. melted sweet butter
2  lb. Athens thin fillo
1  c. honey

      To make the stuffing, combine and mix walnuts, sugar and cardamom.  Set aside.
      Brush a baking dish, measuring about 9 x 13 x 2-inch with some of the melted butter.  Spread one fillo sheet flat in the pan. Brush with about 1 teaspoon butter.  Stack about 15 fillo sheets using this method.  Spread one half of the stuffing mixture on the fillo sheets.  Spread and butter about five fillo sheets on top of the first layer of stuffing.  Spread the remaining half of the stuffing on top.  Spread and butter about 15 fillo sheets to make the top and final layer.  Use more butter if you run out or use less for each fillo layer.
      With a sharp knife, cut in diamond or square shapes.  Pour remaining melted butter on top.  Bake in 350 degrees; oven for about 30 minutes or until the surface turns light golden color.  Pour honey over Baklava.  When at room temperature, transfer individual pieces onto a serving dish.  Serve at room temperature or chilled.
