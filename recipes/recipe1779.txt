SAUERKRAUT BALLS


1/4  lb. ground pork sausage
1/4  lb. ground cooked ham
1/4  lb. ground cooked corned beef
1/4  c. finely chopped onion
1/2  tsp. finely chopped parsley
2  eggs, beaten
1  tsp. salt
1  c. milk
3  c. firmly packed sauerkraut, drained and chopped fine
1/2  tsp. dry mustard
1  c. all-purpose flour
1/2  tsp. salt
3  c. fresh bread crumbs
  melted shortening or oil for deep-frying
2/3  c. water

      Break the pork sausage into small bits and fry in a heavy skillet until lightly browned.  Add the ground ham, corned beef, chopped onion and parsley and continue to cook, stirring frequently with a fork, until hot.  Sift the flour, salt and dry mustard together, then add the meat to the mixture, stirring to combine. Add the milk and continue to cook over low heat until the mixture is thickened.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in the chopped sauerkraut and mix well.  Chill the mixture thoroughly.  Shape the mixture into 4-inch balls.  Roll the balls lightly in flour. Combine the beaten eggs, water and salt to make an egg batter.  Dip the floured balls into the egg batter, then in the fresh bread crumbs.  Deep-fry in 360 degrees; oil for 1 1/2 minutes or until the balls are a golden brown.  Drain on absorbent paper and serve hot.  Dill sauce makes a great sauce to serve with these balls.  To reduce fat:  Bake in a 375 degrees; oven for 30 minutes rather than deep-frying. Extra balls may be stored in a tightly closed container and reheated in the microwave.
