BROWN SUGAR-BOURBON GLAZED HAM


1  (11 to 14 lb.) whole bone-in smoked ham with rind
  whole cloves
1 3/4  c. water
1/2  c. bourbon
1  c. packed dark brown sugar
1 3/4  c. apple cider
1/4  c. Dijon mustard
1/2  tsp. black pepper
1  Tbsp. cider vinegar

      Place unwrapped ham on rack in large roasting pan. Let stand at room temperature 2 hours.
       Preheat oven to 325 degrees;. Trim off rind, leaving 4-inch wide piece intact on narrow shank end. Score fat at 1 1/2-inch intervals for diamond pattern. Stud diamond points with cloves. Place ham, fat side up, on rack in roasting pan; tent with wide heavy-duty foil. Pour the water and 1/4 cup bourbon into pan. Bake 1 hour.
      Glaze:  In saucepan, mix remaining 1/4 cup bourbon, the brown sugar and 3/4 cup cider.  Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar.  Boil 1 minute.  Remove from heat; whisk in mustard and pepper.  After ham has baked 1 hour, remove foil; baste with 1/4 of glaze.  Bake ham 1 1/2 hours longer, basting 3 times with remaining glaze, until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of ham registers 130 degrees;.  Transfer ham to platter; tent with foil. Let stand 15 minutes.  Pour drippings from roasting pan into cup; skim and discard fat.  Place roasting pan across 2 stove top burners over medium-high heat.  Add remaining 1 cup cider, scraping up browned bits from pan.  Add reserved drippings, the vinegar and juices from platter.  Simmer 1 minute.  Serve with ham.  Makes 12 servings with leftovers.
