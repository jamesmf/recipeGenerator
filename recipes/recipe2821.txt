PUNCH WITH A HOLIDAY RING


2 (64 oz.)  cartons Ocean Spray crantastic or cran-orange, chilled
1 (2-liter)  bottle lemon-lime soda
3  fresh lemons
3  fresh limes
1  bottle (750 ml.) white wine (optional)

      The day before your party, make the ring.  Cut 1 lemon and 1 lime into thin slices.  Remove seeds.  Arrange alternating slices of fruit in bottom of 3 1/2-cup ring mold.  Pour in enough crantastic or cran-orange to barely cover fruit.  Freeze until just set.  Now, add enough Ocean Spray to fill mold.  Freeze overnight. Refrigerate remainder of crantastic or cran-orange.
      Just before serving, make punch.  Squeeze juice from remaining lemons and limes.  In a large punch bowl, mix fruit juice with remaining crantastic or cran-orange, lemon-lime soda and wine; stir gently.  Unmold frozen ring and float in punch.  Makes about 35 (6 ounce) servings.
