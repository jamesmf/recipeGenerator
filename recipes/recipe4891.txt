WHITE CHRISTMAS CHILI


4  skinless boneless chicken breasts
5  c. water
1  large onion, chopped and divided
2  Tbsp. butter
2  celery ribs, chopped
3 (16-oz.)  cans great Northern beans, rinsed, drained, divided
3  cans (4.5-oz. each) chopped green chiles
1  c. chicken broth
1  tsp. ground cumin
1  bay leaf
1  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. ground red pepper
1  Tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro

      Place chicken, 5 cups water, and half of onion in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, and cook 1 hour or until chicken is very tender.  Remove chicken, reserving cooking broth in Dutch oven. Cut chicken into bite-size pieces; set aside.
       Melt butter in a skillet; add celery and remaining onion, and saut√© until tender.  Stir chicken, celery mixture, 2 cans of beans, and next 6 ingredients into broth in Dutch oven, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at least 1 hour, stirring frequently, until thickened.  Process remaining 1 can beans in a blender until smooth, stopping to scrape down sides. Stir bean puree into chili.  Heat soup to simmering. Remove and discard bay leaf; stir in cilantro just before serving.
