8  oz. angel hair pasta
1  each small red and yellow bell pepper, cut lengthwise into narrow strips
2  small zucchini, quartered lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces
4  oz. fresh or frozen snow peas
3  Tbsp. olive oil
12  oz. raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
2  cloves garlic, minced
1  pt. grape tomatoes, cut lengthwise in half

	While pasta water comes to a boil, get all ingredients ready to cook before adding the pasta to the boiling water.
	Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook as package directs, adding bell peppers, zucchini and snow peas about 1 minute before pasta will be done. Remove and reserve 3/4 cup cooking water. Drain pasta and vegetables well in a colander. While pasta cooks, heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and saut√© until nicely browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Remove to a large serving bowl. Add garlic to skillet and stir 1 to 2 minutes until golden. Stir in reserved cooking water, then add to bowl with shrimp along with pasta, vegetables and tomatoes. Toss to mix and coat; garnish with fresh basil. Yield: 4 servings.
