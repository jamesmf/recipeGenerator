MALAI SEEKH


2  small chicken breasts
1/4  tsp. each, garlic and ginger paste
1  tsp. green chili paste
1/4  tsp. black pepper
1/2  tsp. salt
2  extra-small potato, boiled
2  large eggs, boiled
1/4  tsp. cinnamon powder
1/4  tsp. garam masala
1  tin  (6 oz.) pure cream
2  small eggs, beaten
  Breadcrumbs
  Oil for deep-frying

      Combine garlic, ginger, green chili paste, black pepper and salt with the chicken.  Add about 1/4 cup water, and lightly boil chicken until cooked through.  Let cool then finely shred with fingers.
      Coarsely chop the eggs and lightly mash the potatoes.  Add both to the shredded chicken.  Mix in cinnamon powder, garam masala and cream.  Combine thoroughly and shape into 3-inch plump seekhs.
      Line a cookie sheet with breadcrumbs and place seekhs on it as you shape them. After all the seekhs are done, shake the cookie sheet back and forth to coat.  Keep doing this until all the seekhs are thoroughly coated with crumbs.
       Dip each seekh in beaten egg and deep-fry until light golden.
