CHAMPAGNE


6  oz. can frozen unsweetened apple juice
18  oz. soda water

      Follow directions on juice can, using flavored carbonated water instead of tap water.  Keep in bottle or jar with a tight fitting lid so bubbles won't disappear.  Makes four 6 ounce servings.
      Variation:  Try other frozen fruit juices such as grape juice. Tastes like soda pop, but contains no added sugar.
