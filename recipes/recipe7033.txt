GROUND BEEF AND OKRA


1  lb. ground meat
  TexJoy Steak seasoning
1/2  onion, chopped
1  can Rotel tomatoes with green chilies
1 or 2  cans tomato sauce
16  oz. frozen okra (or more)
  salt and pepper to taste

      Season ground meat and place in a cast iron pot; add onions and brown; drain off excess grease. Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, and frozen okra. Add enough water to cover okra and simmer over medium heat until okra is tender. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve over rice with a slice of cornbread. Lip smackin' good!
      Tip: If you do not like for your ground meat to be in large clumps, try putting in on to brown with a small amount of water. Stir as the water cooks out. The meat will resemble a fine crumble. An excellent method for making chili etc.
