GRATED POTATO DUMPLINGS
(Pyzy)  

2  lb. peeled potatoes
1  egg
5  Tbsp. flour

      Grate potatoes and allow to drip dry in fine sieve or cloth bag.  Gently press out moisture.  Let the leftover liquid settle; pour off the clear liquid at top and add the sediment (starch) to grated potatoes.  Stir in egg and flour and work into a moist but firm dough.  If it feels too mushy, adding a bit of flour won't hurt.  Transfer dough to moist board; form walnut sized balls between floured hands and cook in boiling salted water.  If you want, leave the dough mushy and spoon it out of bowl with a tablespoon into the boiling water.
