BOK CHOY SENSATIONAL SALAD

Salad Preparation:
1  medium head bok choy
1  bunch green onions

	Wash, core, and chop the bok choy and onions into bite-size pieces.  Chill after drying.
Dry Dressing Preparation:
2 1/2  oz. sesame seeds
2  pkg. ramen noodles broken up (don't use seasoning)
1  pkg. sliced almonds

	Saute the above ingredients in oil, adding a bit of garlic powder and salt.  Cool and store in covered container for an indefinite period of time.
Liquid Salad Dressing Preparation:
3/4  c. oil
1/4  c. rice or cider vinegar
2 generous  Tbsp. soy sauce
1/2  c. sugar

	Combine and boil the above ingredients for no more than one minute.
	 General directions:  Toss the three mixtures together; doing this several hours in advance of the meal will create a strong, pleasant blend of flavor.  The mixtures can be prepared ahead and stored separately.
	For variety, add chopped pimento, mandarin orange segments, or cut-up cooked chicken.  Unlike most salads, this one is delicious the second and third day if any is left!
