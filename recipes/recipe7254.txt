CHICKEN CHILI


1  lb. boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1/2  Tbsp. vegetable oil
1  large onion, chopped
2  ribs celery, sliced
1  clove garlic, minced
1 (14 oz.)  can tomatoes
1 (15 oz.)  can red kidney beans, drained
1  green pepper, diced
2  tsp. chili powder or to taste
3/4  tsp. ground cumin seed
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. black pepper

      Wash chicken and pat dry. Remove visible fat. Cut chicken in 1/2-inch pieces. In large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, cook chicken in hot oil until meat is lightly browned. Add onion, celery and garlic; cook over medium heat until vegetables are tender. Add tomatoes, stirring to break up. Add all remaining ingredients. Cover and allow to simmer for 10 minutes. Remove cover and simmer 15 minutes or until part of the liquid evaporates and chili thickens. Makes 6 servings.
