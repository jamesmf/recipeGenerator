BARBECUE BONANZA


2 1/2  lb. chuck roast (2 inches thick)
  instant meat tenderizer
1 (5 oz.)  bottle soy sauce
1/4  c. firmly packed brown sugar
1  Tbsp. lemon juice
1/4  c. Concord wine
1  tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2  c. water

      At least 6 hours (better if 24 hours) before serving, sprinkle chuck roast with meat tenderizer.  In a 12 x 8 x 2-inch baking dish, blend soy sauce with remaining ingredients; refrigerate chuck roast in sauce, turning once.  Grill chuck roast about 5 inches from hot coals for 30 minutes on each side, brushing occasionally with marinade.  Serve with baked potatoes, tossed green salad and toasted French bread.
