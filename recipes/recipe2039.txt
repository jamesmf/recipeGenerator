CHOCOLATE DIVINITY CANDIES
(Makes About 4 Dozen Candies)  

2 1/2  c. sugar
1/4  tsp. salt
1/2  c. light corn syrup
1/3  c. water
2  egg whites
1  tsp. vanilla
2  oz. baking chocolate, melted
3/4  c. chopped walnuts
48  milk chocolate kisses (8 oz. pkg.), unwrapped

      Combine sugar, salt, corn syrup and water in a 2-quart saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves and mixture boils.  Continue cooking, without stirring, to 260 degrees; or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water separates into threads which feel hard but not brittle (soft-crack stage).  When sugar reaches 246 degrees;, beat egg whites in large mixer bowl until stiff peaks form.  When syrup reaches soft-crack stage, gradually pour in a thin stream into egg whites, beating at high speed on mixer.  Add vanilla and beat until candy begins to hold its shape.  Quickly blend in baking chocolate; stir in nuts.  Drop from teaspoon onto waxed paper-covered baking sheet.  (Divinity should be about the size of walnuts.)  Gently press a milk chocolate kiss on top of each piece.  Store in airtight container.
