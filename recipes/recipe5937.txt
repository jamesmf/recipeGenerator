SEAFOOD DELIGHT SALAD


2  lb. imitation crabmeat
12  black olives
1/2  c. celery
1  bunch green onions
1/2  box colored twisted pasta

      Chop crabmeat, olives, celery and onions. Cook pasta and cool. Mix all ingredients together. Add salad dressing to your liking.
      I like just mayonnaise or Hidden Valley mix with mayonnaise and buttermilk or Italian dressing.
