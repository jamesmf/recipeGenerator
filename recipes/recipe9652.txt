MARINATED CHICKEN WINGS


8  chicken wings
1  small onion, finely chopped
1  Tbsp. oil
1  Tbsp. clear honey
3  Tbsp. tomato ketchup
2  Tbsp. soy sauce
1  tsp. smooth French mustard

      Mix onion, oil, honey, ketchup, soy sauce, and mustard in a plastic or glass bowl (don't use a metal one). Put chicken in and make sure thoroughly coated with the marinade. Leave to marinate for either 1 1/2 hours in the fridge, or for 45 minutes at room temperature. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
       Again make sure chicken is thoroughly coated in marinade and put the pieces on a wire rack above a roasting pan (to catch the drips). Cook for 45 minutes, basting occasionally with marinade.
