CIOPPINO (SEAFOOD STEW)


1  medium onion, chopped
3  cloves garlic, minced
1/2  c. parsley, chopped
1/4  c. olive oil (or less)
28  oz. canned tomatoes
15  oz. tomato sauce
1  c. red wine
1  c. Clamato juice
2  Tbsp. red wine vinegar
2  bay leaves
1 1/2  tsp. mixed Italian herbs
12  small fresh clams
12  fresh mussels
1  lb. fish fillets, cut into 2-inch pieces
1  lb. shrimp, shelled and deveined
3/4  lb. scallops

	Saute onion and garlic over moderate heat in olive oil until soft but not browned. Add parsley, tomatoes, tomato sauce, wine, Clamato juice, vinegar and herbs. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 40 minutes. (Basic sauce can be made ahead, cooled, covered and refrigerated. Heat sauce before adding to seafood.)
	While sauce is simmering, rinse all fish and seafood in cold water.  Scrub clams and mussels thoroughly.  Layer all seafood in large soup pot, placing clams and mussels on top.  Pour hot sauce over all and cover tightly.  Cook over low heat about 20 minutes or until clams and mussels open and shrimp turn pink.
