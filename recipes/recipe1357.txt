VEGETARIAN OMELET


1/2  c. water
1/2  c. rice or oat flour
1/4 to 1/2  c. raw cashews
1  brick tofu
1 1/2  tsp. salt
1  tsp. onion powder
1  tsp. garlic powder
1  Tbsp. chicken-style seasoning

      Combine all ingredients and blend.  Grease Silverstone skillet. Preheat and pour in omelet.  Cover and cook over medium-low heat for 10 minutes or until lightly browned.  Loosen around edges and slide out onto plate.  Turn frypan upside down over plate.  Invert so the uncooked side of omelet is at the bottom of pan.  Cover and fry 10 minutes.  Allow to set for a few minutes.
