GREENS
(Collard*/Turnip/Mustard)  

3 to 4  bunches greens
1/2  onion, sliced
1  Tbsp. cooking oil
1/4  tsp. garlic powder
  pinch of crushed red pepper
2  to 3 garlic cloves, diced
1/2  bell pepper, sliced (optional)
1/2  Tbsp. honey
  vegie-sal to your taste

      You will also need a pot with lid.
      First, pick greens and wash approximately 4 to 5 washings.  If insects are present, add salt to at least two washings.  The salt helps detach the insects from the leaves.  In pot, heat oil and add garlic, onions and bell pepper.  Saut over medium heat for approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  Add approximately 1 cup of water and dry seasonings except red pepper.  Bring to boil.  Leave greens whole to retain most of the nutrients.  Add honey and then greens to pot.  Cover pot with lid.  Cook greens over medium heat for about 30 to 40 minutes.  Add water if needed to prevent scorching.
      After greens have cooked about 25 minutes, add crushed red pepper.  Serve with sliced tomatoes and onions.
      *Collard greens take a little longer to cook than turnip and mustard greens.
