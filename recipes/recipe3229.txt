KRISPY STARFISH


1  c ranch dressing
1  lb pkg salad size shrimp (little ones)
1  green pepper, chopped
1  medium vidalia onion, chopped
8  oz cream cheese
2  c shredded cheese
1  pkg won-ton wrappers
2  tbsp bay seasoning
1  tsp salt
1  tsp pepper

      Place wontons in a muffin pan.  Bake 350 degrees; for 5 minutes. They will form crispy star-like cups.  Mix together all ingredients in a bowl.  Mixture should be moist but not soupy. Scoop mixture into each cup using a heaping teaspoon.  Sprinkle top of mixture with a little shredded cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 10 minutes and serve warm or let cool.
