CHARLOTTE'S CHICKEN & RICE


1  whole chicken
2  c. uncooked rice
2  cans of Cream of Mushroom Soup
1  can of Cream of Chicken Soup

      Boil one whole chicken.  When done, debone and strain the broth.  Add two cups of rice to the broth and cook rice per directions.   Add deboned chicken, two cans of cream of mushroom soup, and one can of cream of chicken soup, onion, celery seed and black pepper to taste.
      Cook at 350 degrees; for about an hour (or until hot and bubbly) in a 9x13 pan.  I usually cover with aluminum foil.
