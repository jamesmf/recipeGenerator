CHICKEN CURRY


2  chickens, cut into 8 pieces each
4  garlic cloves
3  large, spanish onions
2  tsp. fresh grated ginger root (peeled)
2  medium-sized ripe tomatoes, chopped
2  large jalapeno peppers, sliced
1  bunch cilantro, chopped
1-1/2  tsp. salt
1  tsp. paprika
6  cloves
2  large bay leaves
1/2  tsp. turmeric
4  cardamom
3/4  vegetable oil
  4-5 cups water

      Wash and drain chicken in colander.  Place the oil in a large cooking pot, preferably a heavy cast aluminium pot.  Peel and thinly slice the onions and garlic and place them in the oil that has been pre-heated at medium-high heat.  Cook these until golden brown, stirring occasionally.
      To this, add the chicken pieces, and brown the meat on one side, then turn the pieces and brown the other side.  Stir well to blend the meat together with the onions and garlic.
      Add the dry herbs and spices, salt, jalapeno peppers and chopped tomato.  Stir well and add water.  Cover the pot with a lid and cook until meat is tender.
      During the last 5 minutes of cooking, stir in cilantro.  Serve with white rice, or pita bread.
