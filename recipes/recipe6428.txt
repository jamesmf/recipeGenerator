BROCCOLI SALAD
(Or Broccoli/Cauliflower Salad)  

1  small onion, chopped
8  slices bacon (or 1 small jar bacon bits)
1  head broccoli (and cauliflower if desired), chopped
2  carrots, shredded
1/2  lb. hard salami, or pepperoni
8  oz. cheddar cheese
  raisins or nuts if desired
  Sweet and sour dressing

      Combine all ingredients and toss.  Top with dressing.  I use the Marzetti Sweet and Sour Fat Free, but you can use regular Sweet and Sour or any other dressing.
