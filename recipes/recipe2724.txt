BUNNY SUNDAE


  vanilla or chocolate ice cream
4  miniature marshmallows
12  small red candies
1  bag jelly beans
1  c. grated coconut
  green food color
1  can whip cream (optional)

      Mix 3 or 4 drops of food coloring with the coconut.  Use this for "grass" in 4 small bowls.  Cut 4 red or pink jelly beans in half.  In each bowl, put 2 scoops of ice cream.  Use jelly beans for ears, small red candies for eyes and nose, and a miniature marshmallow for a tail.  For a fluffier bunny, cover ice cream with whip cream first.  Sprinkle a few jelly beans on the coconut and enjoy!
