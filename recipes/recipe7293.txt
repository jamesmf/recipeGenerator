(Makes 4 Servings)  

1/4  c. lemon juice (fresh)
3  Tbsp. water
1  tsp. olive oil
1/2  tsp. oregano (dried)
1/2  tsp. Greek-style seasoning
1/4  tsp. pepper
2  cloves garlic, crushed
24  oz. chicken breast (no skin, no bone, R-T-C; 4 breasts)
  cooking spray
3  c. orzo, cooked with no fat
1/3  c. ripe olives, sliced
1 1/2  Tbsp. chives, chopped
1  Tbsp. reduced-calorie margarine, melted
3/4  tsp. Greek-style seasoning

      Combine first 7 ingredients in a large heavy-duty zip-top plastic bag. Add chicken; seal and marinate in the refrigerator 30 minutes.
      Remove chicken from bag, reserving marinade. Prepare grill. Place chicken on grill rack coated with cooking spray; cover and grill 10 minutes on each side or until chicken is done, basting occasionally with reserved marinade.
       Combine orzo and next 4 ingredients in a bowl; toss gently to coat. Divide orzo mixture evenly among individual plates. Place chicken breast on top of orzo. Garnish with oregano sprigs, if desired.
