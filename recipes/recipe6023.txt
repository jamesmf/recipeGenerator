CHICKEN SALAD


3 to 4  cans of white chicken, shredded (I use the Members Mark brand from Sam's Club)
5  to 6 boiled eggs, peeled and chopped
  celery, to taste
  Mayonnaise, to moisten (as much or as little as you like)
  salt and pepper to taste
1  pkg. dried cranberries (Cranraisins)

      Mix all ingredients together and chill thoroughly.  Serve with crackers.
