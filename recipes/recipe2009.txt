BREAKFAST BURRITO


1  pkg. soft shells (taco or burrito)
1  doz. eggs
1  lb. Polish sausage
1  medium tomato, diced
1  medium potato, diced
1  medium onion, diced
1/2  c. milk

      Dice and saut√© sausage, potato and onion in large skillet. Brown and add tomato pieces.  Crack eggs and stir until well blended as if you're scrambling the eggs in large bowl.  Add milk; stir.  When sausage mixture is browned, add egg mixture and scramble.  When the eggs are cooked, put them into the burrito shells (about 3/4 cup into each) and wrap shells around egg mixture.  Put two stuffed burritos in foil and bake for 15 minutes.
      If you like a spicy taste, add Tabasco sauce to baked burrito by unfolding.  Serves 5 easily.  Keeps in the refrigerator for about 5 days.
