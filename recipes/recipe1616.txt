FLAMED BANANAS


4  Tbsp. butter
3  Tbsp. brown sugar
1  tsp. vanilla
1/2  tsp. cinnamon
1/2  c. fresh orange juice
  juice of 1 lemon
6  bananas, peeled
1/2  c. banana liqueur

 
Garnish:
  grated rind of 1 lemon
  grated rind of 1 orange

      In a large heavy skillet, melt butter over low heat.  Add brown sugar and stir until it melts.  Add vanilla, cinnamon, orange and lemon juice.  Cut a 1/4-inch slice off each banana.  Place bananas in the skillet, cut side down, and heat until warmed, but not "mushy."  Place bananas on a serving platter.  Increase heat under skillet and reduce pan juices until syrupy and heavily coat a spoon.  Warm liqueur.  Add to skillet and ignite.  Pour over bananas and sprinkle with garnish.  Serves 6.
