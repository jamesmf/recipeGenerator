CHILI PARMESAN CHICKEN


2  Tbsp. Kraft grated parmesan cheese
2  tsp. chili powder
4  small boneless skinless chicken breast halves (1 lb.)

      Mix cheese and chili powder in pie plate.  Add chicken; turn to evenly coat on all sides.  Place chicken on ungreased baking sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.  Makes 4 servings.
      Note:  Always cook chicken until no longer pink in center. When checking for doneness, pierce chicken with a fork and make sure that juices run clear.
