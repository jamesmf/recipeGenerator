ALL-DAY-LONG CROCKPOT BEEF


1  1/2 lbs beef roast (any type of beef roast)
1/2  tsp black pepper
2  garlic cloves, minced
1/2  pkg onion soup mix
2  tsp worcestershire sauce
1  tsp steak sauce
3  carrots, sliced
2  celery stalks, diced
1  green pepper, chopped
1  yellow onion
1/2  cup water
1/2  cup tomato juice

      Cut beef roast into serving sized portions.  Use more beef if you need more that 6 servings.  Brown beef in a bit of vegetable oil, although you can skip this step if you're rushed for time. Slice onion and separate into rings.  Dice the peeled carrots, dice the celery and slice the peppers into thin strips or circles. Place these into bottom of the Crockpot.  Sprinkle the beef pieces with fresh ground black pepper, minced garlic and the onion soup mix.  Place on top of the vegetables.  Mix the steak sauce and worcestershire sauce in a small bowl with about 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup tomato juice.  Pour this over the meat.  Turn the crockpot to high for 30 minutes, or if you're in a hurry, skip this step. Turn to low cover and let cook for 7 - 9 hours.  Keep the crockpot covered as much as possible through out cooking time.  When ready to serve, dip meat and vegetables out with a slotted spoon, use the liquid in the crockpot as is or turn the crockpot to high and thicken liquid with a little flour or cornstarch.
