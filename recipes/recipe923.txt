TROUT ALMONDINE


6  lb. lake trout fillets
2  c. flour
1  Tbsp. salt
1  tsp. white pepper
1  Tbsp. m.s.g.
1/4  tsp. garlic powder
1  c. butter, divided
1 1/2  lb. almonds
1  c. Rhine or Riesling wine

      Clean and wipe, but do not wash, the trout after cutting into portion-size pieces.  Mix flour, salt, white pepper, m.s.g. and garlic powder.  Dredge trout pieces in seasoned flour.  Using a large, heavy frypan, heat 1/2 cup of the butter to bubbling point. Brown trout for 4 minutes on each side.  Put trout in a warm oven to keep hot.
      Skin and slice almonds.  Using a small frypan, heat remaining butter until deep golden brown.  Then saut√© the almonds until golden, tossing them about so that they will all color equally. Add wine to the almonds and heat.  Pour over cooked trout and serve.  Serves 8 to 10.
