VEGETABLE SALAD BOWL
(Good as a main dish on a hot summer day.)  
Salad:
1  package of frozen mixed vegetables
1/2  head lettuce, torn
1  onion, chopped
1/2  cup grated sharp cheddar cheese
1/2  lb. diced chicken, bologna, or salami (meat of choice)
1  tomato, chopped in eighths
1/2  unpared cucumber, sliced
1  cup (half of a 2 1/4 oz. can) shoestring potatoes

 
Astoria Dressing:
1/2  cup mayonnaise
1  Tbsp. (or more) catsup
1/2  basic french dressing (as below)

 
Basic French Dressing:
1 1/2  cup salad oil
1/3  cup vinegar
1/2  tsp. sugar
1 1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
1  tsp. paprika
1/2  tsp. dry mustard

      Cook, drain, and cool the mixed vegetables.  Toss the cooked vegetables with all remaining salad ingredients except shoestring potatoes.  Add the potatoes just before serving.
      Prepare the basic french dressing and add 1/2 cup of it to 1/2 cup mayonnaise and 1 (or more) Tbsp. catsup.
      This salad is very colorful and contains four food groups.  It is great for a hot day when you don't want to cook.  Great for picnics and covered dish dinners as well.
