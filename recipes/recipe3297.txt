SALSA


2  cans (15 1/2 oz.) tomatoes
1  medium onion
1/2 to 3/4  c. pickled jalapeno peppers
1  Tbsp. garlic salt
1/8  tsp. black pepper
1/2  Tbsp. ground red pepper

      Put all ingredients in blender and chop up in blender. Pour into quart jar and refrigerate.
       Salsa gets hotter the longer it sits. Do not leave out overnight because salsa is not processed.
