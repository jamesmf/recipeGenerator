1 1/2  tsp. baking powder
1/2  tsp. salt
2  Tbsp. butter or margarine
1/2  c. shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

      Sift  flour,  baking  powder and salt into medium bowl. Cut in  butter or margarine with pastry blender until mixture is crumbly.  Add  cheese.  Toss until well blended.  Sprinkle water over  mixture  and  mix  lightly with fork until pastry holds together and leaves the side of the bowl clean.  Roll on a floured surface into a 12 x 10-inch rectangle.
