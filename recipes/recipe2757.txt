APPLE PIE


2 1/2  lb. cooking apples, pared, quartered, cored and thinly sliced
1/3  c. firmly packed light brown sugar
1/3  c. granulated sugar
1  Tbsp. cornstarch or 2 1/2 Tbsp. flour
1  tsp. ground cinnamon
1/4  tsp. salt
1  pkg. pre-made or ready-made crust
2  Tbsp. butter or margarine
  water or milk
  sugar for sprinkling

      Place apples in a large bowl.  Mix sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a small bowl.  Sprinkle over apples and toss gently to mix.  Let stand until a little juice forms, approximately 10 minutes.
      Meanwhile, prepare pie crust mix, following label instructions. Roll out 1/2 of dough to 12 inch round on lightly floured surface; fix into a 9-inch pie plate.  Trim overhang to 1/2 inch.  Roll out remaining pastry for top of a 12 inch round; fold into quarters. Make 3 slits near center in each of folded edges for steam to escape.  Pile apple mixture into pastry; dot with butter or margarine, moisten edge of bottom pastry with water and place folded pastry on apples so point is in center.  Unfold.  Turn overhang to 1 inch; turn edges under and press together to seal. Pinch to make stand up edge.
      For crispy-sugar topping, brush top of pastry with a little water or milk and sprinkle lightly with sugar.  Bake pie in a hot 425 degrees; oven for 40 minutes or until juices bubble through slits and apples are tender.  If edge is browning too fast, cover with narrow strips of foil.  Serve warm with scoop of vanilla ice cream or Cheddar cheese.
