HALIBUT STEAKS


1/3  c. brandy
1/3  c. lemon juice
1/4  tsp. dill weed
1  bay leaf
4  halibut steaks (about 1 1/2 lb.)
1  medium red onion, thinly sliced
1/3  c. chili sauce
2  Tbsp. melted oleo
  salt to taste
1/2  lemon, thinly sliced

      Combine brandy, lemon juice, dill weed and bay leaf.  Place steaks in shallow pan in a single layer.  Top with onion and lemon slices.  Pour brandy mixture over.  Refrigerate and let stand an hour or longer before cooking.  Drain steaks, reserving marinade. Place steaks on grill over hot coals.  Combine chili sauce and butter with marinade.  Baste steaks often with mixture as they broil.  Cook about 5 minutes each side, just until fish is cooked through and flakes easily.  Sprinkle with salt to taste.  Makes 4 servings.
