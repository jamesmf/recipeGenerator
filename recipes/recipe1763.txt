BUNUELOS DE PLANTO
(Banana Fritters)  

1  c. flour
1  egg, lightly beaten
1/2  c. milk
2  Tbsp. sugar
6  firm ripe bananas, peeled and cut lengthwise in half, then crosswise into quarters
  vegetable oil or shortening for deep-fat frying
  confectioners sugar
1/4  tsp. salt
1  Tbsp. butter, melted
1  egg white
1/4  c. dark rum or brandy

      To prepare the batter, sift 1/2 cup of the flour and the salt into a deep mixing bowl.  Stir in the beaten egg and butter and then the milk and continue to stir until the batter is smooth.  Do not beat or overstir.  For the best results, set the batter aside at room temperature and let it rest for an hour or so, although it may be used at once if it must.  In either case, the egg white should be beaten with a whisk or rotary beater until stiff and then folded into the batter just before using it.
      Meanwhile in a large bowl, combine the sugar and rum or brandy and stir until the sugar dissolves.  Drop in the bananas and turn them about with a spoon until they are thoroughly moistened.  Set aside at room temperature, turning the bananas occasionally.  Heat 3 to 4-inches of oil or shortening in a deep-fat fryer or a large heavy skillet until it reaches 375 degrees; on a deep-frying thermometer. Pat the pieces of banana dry with paper towels; dip them in the remainder 1/2 cup of flour and shake vigorously to remove the excess.  With tongs, dip them into the batter and then deep-fry them, 5 or 6 at a time, for 2 or 3 minutes or until golden brown on all sides.  Transfer the fried fritters to paper towels and let them drain while you fry the remaining bananas.  Serve warm, liberally sprinkled with confectioners sugar.
