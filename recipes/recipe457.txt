HAMBURGER AND POTATO THING


1  lb. lean ground beef, browned
1  lb. frozen shredded hash brown potatoes, completely thawed
1  c. sour cream
1  c. grated Cheddar cheese
1  can undiluted mushroom soup
1/2  tsp. salt
1  can French fried onions, divided

      Combine all ingredients, adding 1/2 of onion rings last.  Mix well.  Place in greased 13 x 9-inch pan.  Bake at 350 degrees; for about 30 to 40 minutes or until mixture bubbles.  Sprinkle remaining onion rings over top last 5 minutes.  Remove; let sit 5 minutes before serving.  This is good to make ahead and refrigerate until ready to use.  Baking time will be longer if refrigerated.
