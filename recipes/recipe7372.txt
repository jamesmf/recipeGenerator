BEEF ROLL-UPS


1  box stuffing mix
2  lb. round steak
2  c. water
8  Tbsp. butter
  salt and pepper

      Make stuffing according to directions on box.  Cut steak into thin pieces, about 4 1/2 x 2-inches; score.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Spread some dressing on each piece of meat.  Roll up and fasten with skewer or toothpicks.  Roll in flour and brown in butter.  Add 2 cups water (meat stock is better) and simmer for 1 1/2 hours until tender.  Remove toothpicks.  Pour gravy over meat. Garnish with chopped parsley.  Serve with mashed potatoes.
