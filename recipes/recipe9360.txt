CARIBBEAN SHRIMP AND PEPPERS OVER RICE PILAF


1  lb. fresh large shrimp, in shell
1  Tbsp. Jamaican jerk rub
2  tsp. olive oil
1  each red and green bell pepper
1/2  medium onion, cut into thin wedges
2  cloves garlic, minced
2  tsp. olive oil
1 14 1/2  oz. can chicken broth
1 8  oz. can crushed pineapple, undrained
1  tsp. Jamaican jerk rub
1  c. uncooked rice

      Peel shrimp; remove tails if desired.  Blend jerk rub with 2 tsp. oil in a medium bowl; add shrimp, toss to coat and set aside. Meanwhile, prepare rice.  Cut onion into wedges.  Mince garlic. Heat oil in a 2 quart pot over medium-high heat.  Sauté onion and garlic 2 to 3 minutes.  Pour in chicken broth; stir in pineapple and jerk seasoning. Bring to a boil, then stir in rice.  Cover pot; reduce heat to low and simmer 15 minutes or until liquid is absorbed.  Set aside.  While rice cooks, seed peppers and remove stems; cut peppers into thin wedges.  Heat a large, non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.  Sauté shrimp and peppers 2 to 4 minutes, until shrimp turn opaque, white, and form the letter "C". Serve shrimp and peppers over pilaf.
