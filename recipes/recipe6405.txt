GREEK TUNA SALAD


12  large ripe tomatoes, cored and cut into wedges
2  large red onions, cut into thin slivers
2 1/2  lb. Feta cheese, crumbled
96  Greek olives
4 (12.5 oz.)  cans solid white tuna, separated into bite-sized pieces
2  c. drained and canned chickpeas
1/3  c. chopped fresh parsley leaves
1 1/2  tsp. dried oregano
  salt and freshly ground black pepper
  extra virgin olive oil
  red wine vinegar

      Gently combine the first 8 ingredients (through the oregano) in a large bowl. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Drizzle 1 cup of the olive oil and 1/2 cup of the vinegar over the salad and toss gently. The ingredients should only be coated lightly with the oil and vinegar. Add a little more of each and gently toss again. Serve with crisp lettuce greens, if desired.
