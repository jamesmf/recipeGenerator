1  1/2 cherry tomatoes, cut into quarters
1 (16 oz.)  can sliced beets, drained
1  large green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces

1/4  c. diced sweet pickles
1/4  c. vegetable oil
3  Tbsp. white wine vinegar
1  tsp. lemon pepper seasoning
3/4  tsp. seasoned salt

      In resealable plastic bag or large bowl, combine all vegetables.  Toss well. In small bowl, combine remaining ingredients.  Blend well.
