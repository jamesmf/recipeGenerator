HOT AND SOUR SOUP


  Prepared chicken stock
1/8  cup green chillies cut diagonally
1/4  cup shredded cabbage
1/4  cup shredded carrots
1/4  cup peas
1/4  cup ketchup
3  Tbsp. vinegar
  Salt, pepper, ajeeno moto
1/3  cup corn flour
  Egg whites

      Heat chicken stock to nearly boiling point and add the first seven ingredients.  Boil covered, for a half hour, over medium/low heat, stirring occasionally.  When cabbage and carrots are soft, mix the corn flour with cold water and combine with soup, stirring constantly.  Beat egg whites and add to soup using a swirling motion.  Wait until egg whites are fluffy and floating atop the soup, then your soup is ready.
