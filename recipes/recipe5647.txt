CHICKEN-AVOCADO TORTILLA SOUP


1/3  c. chopped onion
3  cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
3/4  tsp. ground cumin
3/4  tsp. dried oregano
1/4  tsp. chili powder
1/4  tsp. pepper
8  c. fat-free chicken broth
1 (14 oz.)  can diced tomatoes
1 (4 oz.)  can diced green chilies
10  corn tortillas (6-inch wide)
1 1/2  lb. chicken breasts (boneless and skinless)
1  firm-ripe avocado
2  Tbsp. fresh cilantro, chopped
  salt to taste
1/2  c. shredded reduced-fat sharp Cheddar cheese

	In a 5 to 6-quart nonstick pan over medium heat, stir onion, garlic, cumin, oregano, chili powder and pepper until spices are fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add broth, tomatoes (including juice) and green chilies. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.
	 Meanwhile, stack tortillas and cut into 1/8-inch wide strips. Add to boiling broth. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
	 Rinse chicken and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Peel the avocado, pit and thinly slice. Add chicken to broth and return to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until chicken is white in center (cut to test), about 5 minutes.  Stir in cilantro and salt to taste. Ladle into soup bowls, garnish with avocado and add cheese to taste.  Makes 6 servings.
	The thinly sliced corn tortillas thicken the soup as they dissolve.
