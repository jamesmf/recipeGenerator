LEMON ZUCCHINI SOUP


2  Tbsp. butter
1  large onion, sliced
1  garlic clove, peeled and mashed to a paste with salt

1 1/2 to 2  c. chicken stock
  grated peel of 1 lemon
  juice of 2 lemons
  salt and pepper to taste

      In heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add onion and garlic and cook until soft, but not browned, 6 minutes.  Add the zucchini slices, cover and cook until soft, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Stir to keep from browning.
      Puree the zucchini mixture in a food processor until smooth. Return the mixture to the pan and add the chicken stock and lemon peel.  Season to taste with lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Serve hot!
