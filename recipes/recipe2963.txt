QUESADILLAS


4  to 6 boneless/skinless chicken breasts or 1 small roast beef
1  doz. large flour tortillas
2  lb. Mexican mix cheese
1  small onion
1 small  can diced green chiles
1 small  can sliced black olives
  sour cream
  salsa
2 to 4  Tbsp. oil

      If using beef, you must cook in a crock-pot all day until the meat falls apart. Remove all fat and pull meat apart into shreds. If using chicken, dice up all meat and then cook in about 2 to 4 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan until chicken is done.
      Heat your griddle (400 degrees;) or frying pan, then place a tortilla in pan and sprinkle with cheese.  Top with chicken, onion, green chiles and black olives.  Place another tortilla on top and brown both sides.  Cut with a pizza cutter just like a pizza, place on a platter and serve with salsa and sour cream in the middle of the platter.  Serves 6 to 8.
