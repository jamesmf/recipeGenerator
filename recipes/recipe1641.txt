ROAST PORK
(Flaeskesteg)  

5 to 6  lb. leg of pork
  about 1/3 pt. stock
  salt
  ground black pepper
4 to 6  Tbsp. cream
1  Tbsp. tomato puree
  soy sauce
  cornstarch for thickening

      Score the pork and rub with salt, mustard powder and little pepper.  Place on a grid and roast at 480 degrees; for about 1/2 hour or until the crackling turns white.
      Turn the oven down to 360 degrees; and pour in the boiling stock.
      Roast the joint for a further 2 1/4 hours, depending on the size.  Do not baste or the crackling will become soft, but turn down the heat if it becomes too dark.
      Pour the gravy into a small saucepan, leaving the joint to keep hot in the oven with the door ajar.  Skim the fat off the gravy and add the cream to taste.  Boil up with the salt, pepper, tomato puree and soy sauce, thickening with corn starch if desired.
      Serve with red cabbage and caramelized potatoes.
