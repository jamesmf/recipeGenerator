CHEESY POTATO SOUP


5  c. diced potatoes
1 1/2  c. diced carrots
1 1/2  c. diced celery
1  c. diced onion
2  tsp. salt
  water
1  can evaporated milk
1  c. half and half
2  c. Velveeta cheese (1/2 large brick)
1/4  c. butter
  pepper to taste
2  c. cooked and diced ham

      Combine potatoes, carrots, celery and onion in a large pot. Add salt and enough water to cover the vegetables. Boil for about 20 minutes or until vegetables are soft.
