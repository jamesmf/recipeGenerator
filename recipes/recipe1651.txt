POTATO CASSEROLE


4  c. fluffy (not dry) mashed potatoes
1/4  c. flour
4  Tbsp. dark corn syrup

      Beat mashed potatoes with a rotary beater.  Mix in the flour and syrup until well blended.  Turn the mixture into a heavy buttered casserole; cover tightly and let cook in a warm oven (lowest heat) 5 hours.  Check occasionally to be sure that it doesn't get too dry.  Add milk, if necessary.  Leave cover off; dot with butter and bake at 350 degrees; for 15 minutes at the end of the 5 hours to form a crust on top.
