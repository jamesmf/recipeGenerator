2  lb. ground beef
1  chopped onion
1  c. chopped mushrooms
  garlic powder
1 (16 oz.)  can tomato sauce
1 (16 oz.)  can golden mushroom soup
4  slices American cheese
  tomato juice
2  lb. spaghetti
3  Tbsp. canola oil

      Fill large pot with water and oil.  Bring to a boil.  Put meat in skillet and brown.  When 1/2 done, cover in garlic powder. Put onion with meat.  Drain and put back in skillet on medium heat.  Add tomato sauce, golden mushroom soup and mushrooms until it bubbles while stirring.  Turn to low heat and add cheese.  When it melts, it's done.  When water boils, put spaghetti in.  When you throw it against the wall and it sticks, it's done.  If you think sauce is too thick, add tomato juice.
