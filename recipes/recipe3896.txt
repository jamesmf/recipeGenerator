10  lb. watermelon rind
  cold water
1  c. pickling lime
2  Tbsp. salt

 
Syrup:
1/2  gal. white vinegar
8  lb. sugar
3/4  c. (a handful) pickling spices, tied in several layers of cheesecloth

      Peel both sides of watermelon rind and cube into pieces about 1 to 1 1/2-inches square. Soak overnight in cold water with about a cup of dissolved pickling lime.
       Next morning, rinse and boil in salted water using about 2 tablespoons salt. Drain, then boil in fresh water for 20 minutes. Drain and cook in syrup until clear and tender. Jar and seal in sterilized jars. If it cools some, it does not matter. Use wooden spoon handle in jar to let out air. You may also use okra, carrots, string beans, etc. instead of watermelon rind.
