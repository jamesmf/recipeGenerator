COCONUT CANDY


1  box confectioners sugar
1  can coconut
  milk as needed
  cinnamon

      Mix sugar, coconut and 1 tablespoon milk.  Add 1 tablespoon of milk at a time until mixture will hold its shape, but is not too wet and sticky.  Dust each child's hands with confectioners sugar. Give each child a portion of the candy on a sheet of wax paper. Let the children shape candy into 1/2-inch balls and roll in cinnamon.
