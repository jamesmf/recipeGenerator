CHEESY CHEESE BALL


1/2  lb. cream cheese (room temperature)
5/8 to 3/4  lb. sharp Cheddar cheese (room temperature)
3  oz. Velveeta cheese (room temperature)
  seasoning salt to taste
3  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
1  Tbsp. mayonnaise

      Mix all ingredients thoroughly.  I use my hands, clean of course! Leave in container and refrigerate until chilled.  When cold, shape into a ball (or divide into smaller balls) and roll in ground pecans.  Nuts can be chopped any way you want them.  I divide the mixture into 4 balls sometimes!
