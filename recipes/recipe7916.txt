      Shell prawns.  Devein and rinse well.  Drain in colander. Braise in a little oil (separate from above quantity) until they change to a light pink color.  In another pot, fry sliced onions until pale gold.  Just as they begin to deepen in color, add tomato with all the other ingredients.  Braise for a few minutes and add prawns, adding a little water to cook them well.  When curry is nice and thickly pureed, add 1/4 tsp. garam masala and garnish with a sprig of curry leaves.
