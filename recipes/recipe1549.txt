CHOCOLATE MILK SHAKE OR MALT


1/2  c. cold half and half
2  Tbsp. chocolate syrup
1  1/2 malted milk powder (if malt)*
3  scoops (3/4 c.) chocolate ice cream
  freshly grated nutmeg for garnish (optional)

      In a blender combine the ingredients and process for about 30 seconds, or until well mixed and frothy.  Pour into a tall glass and serve immediately with a straw.  Garnish with nutmeg, if desired.
      *If you prefer to omit the malted milk powder, you may combine the other ingredients for a thick chocolate shake.  (For a richer drink, substitute whipping cream for half and half and use a very creamy ice cream.  For a lighter drink, use milk for the half and half.)
