SPONGE CANDY OR FAIRY FOOD


1  c. sugar
1  c. dark corn syrup
1  Tbsp. vinegar
1  Tbsp. baking soda
1  Tbsp. vanilla

      Mix sugar, corn syrup and vinegar in a large saucepan.  Cover tightly and bring to a boil.  Uncover and place a candy thermometer in the pan.  Without stirring, cook over medium heat to 300 degrees;. Gradually lower heat as mixture thickens, to prevent scorching. Remove from heat and quickly stir in baking soda and vanilla.  Turn into a buttered 9 x 13-inch pan.  Do not spread.  Candy will spread itself.  Cool.  Break into pieces.  May eat candy as is or you may dip pieces in chocolate dip.
