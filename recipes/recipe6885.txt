RED BEAN CHILI


1  pack dry red beans
1  medium pack ground meat or deer meat
1  onion, chopped fine
1/2  bell pepper
  parsley flakes
1  can Ro-Tel
1 (8 oz.)  can tomato sauce
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper
1  pack chili seasoning
1/2  tsp. minced garlic
  salt to taste

	Brown meat and drain well. Add your seasoning and fry down until onions are clear. Now boil your beans. When they start to crack open, add your tomato sauce, meat mixture and Ro-Tel tomatoes to beans. Finish cooking them by adding your chili seasoning to the pot. Cook on low to medium heat until thick and creamy. Remember to smash your beans on the side of the pot when you stir for cream ones.
