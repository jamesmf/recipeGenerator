ROAST PORK WITH FENNEL


2  lb. pork tenderloin or boneless chops (6)
1  bottle fennel seeds
  garlic powder
  salt
  pepper
  onion powder
2  Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil

      Sprinkle generous amounts of garlic powder, salt, pepper and onion powder on all sides of meat and roll in fennel seeds.
       Preheat oven to 350 degrees;. Heat saut pan to medium-high; get pan hot and add oil. Begin to add pork that has been prepared/crusted with spices and fennel seeds. Sear on each side about 2 minutes so seeds begin to caramelize before turning. Finish baking in oven about 15 to 20 minutes for tenderloin and 10 to 15 minutes for chops.
       Even if you don't like fennel, you've got to try this!!
