SHRIMP ANDOUILLE CHOWDER


1/4  c. (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
1/2  lb. andouille sausage, chorizo or other fully cooked smoked spiced sausage, cut into 1/2-inch dice
3/4  c. each: diced onion, celery and carrot
2  tsp. minced garlic
1/4  c. all-purpose flour
3  c. chicken broth
1  c. heavy cream
1  sweet potato, peeled and diced (1 1/2 c.)
1/2  lb. medium shrimp (about 16), peeled and deveined
2  Tbsp. chopped fresh basil
1  Tbsp. fresh lime juice
1  tsp. each: chopped fresh thyme, coarse (kosher) salt and black pepper

      In a 4 to 5-quart Dutch oven, heat butter over medium-high heat. Add sausage and saut, stirring occasionally, for 2 to 3 minutes until sausage is browned. Stir in onion, celery, carrot and garlic; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover pot and cook for 4 to 5 minutes until onion and other vegetables are softened.
      Uncover pot and sprinkle flour evenly over vegetables; stir to thoroughly mix in flour and then cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Gradually stir in 1 cup chicken broth until flour is well blended into liquid. Slowly add remaining chicken broth, then the heavy cream, stirring mixture constantly so no lumps form. Increase heat to medium-high; slowly bring mixture to a boil, stirring frequently. Add sweet potato and reduce heat to medium. Cover pot and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, until potato is just tender. Add shrimp and remaining ingredients to pot, stirring to combine. Simmer for 1 minute, just until shrimp are cooked through (be careful not to overcook shrimp). Serve chowder with Marjoram Corn Muffins. Makes 4 servings.
