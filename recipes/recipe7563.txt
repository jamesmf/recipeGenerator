CHILI


4  cans (28 oz. each), whole tomatoes
3  medium onions, coarsely chopped
4  cans (12 to 16 oz. each) hot chili beans in chili sauce
2  pkgs. Wick Fowler's 2-alarm chili kit
3  lbs. ground chuck
2  pkgs. (1.75 oz. each) chili seasoning mix (French's, McCormick's, etc.)
  Fresh hot peppers (optional)
  Condiments:  Chopped jalapeno peppers, onions, cheese

      Pour tomatoes with juice into 5 quart bowl or pan.  Coarsely chop tomatoes.  Pour into 5 quart stockpot.  Add chopped onions and hot chili beans; cook on medium heat until onions are crisp tender.  Add only the following ingredients from Wick Fowler's chili kit:  paprika, garlic, salt, cumin/oregano, chili powder, red pepper to taste.  Cook about 1 hour, stirring frequently.
       Cook ground chuck in skillet, breaking meat into small pieces until done and meat is brown.  Stir 2 packages chili seasoning mix into meat; stir constantly to keep from burning.  Pour into stockpot mixture.  Rinse skillet, scrapping meat and seasoning from bottom; add to stockpot.  For extra spice, add hot peppers to taste.  Cook just above a simmer (slightly bubbling) until chili becomes a rich red color, about 1 1/2 hours.
      Freezes well.  1 recipe fills about 3 one-half gallon containers.  Orange juice cartons are great.  Thaw overnight on countertop, from about 10 pm to early morning.  Refrigerate until ready to heat;  warm slowly, stirring often, as this chili sticks easily.
      Note:  Have an extra can of tomatoes and chili beans on hand to adjust recipe to desired thickness.  I transfer cooked chili to a decorative stockpot (i.e., Kensington Garden stockpot) for serving. Dipping from the stockpot with a regular coffee cup works best for me; between servings, place cup in its saucer beside the stockpot. Of course, a long-handled spoon or ladle works well.  Let guests serve themselves.
      Serve with hot cornbread or saltines, and condiments, such as: chopped jalapeno peppers, chopped red onion, chopped green onions with blades, chopped cheddar cheese.
