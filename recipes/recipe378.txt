BLUEBERRY MUFFINS


1/2  c. all-purpose flour
1/4  c. sugar
1 1/2  tsp. baking powder
1/4  tsp. salt
2  egg whites
2/3  c. orange juice
2  Tbsp. cooking oil
1  tsp. vanilla
1  c. fresh or frozen blueberries

      Mix together the first  4  ingredients in a medium-size bowl. In a small bowl  beat egg whites, orange juice, oil and vanilla; add to dry ingredients until just moistened.  Fold in blueberries. Fill muffin  cups (sprayed with nonstick cooking spray) about half full.  Bake  at 400 degrees; for 17 minutes or until golden brown. Cool before serving.  Makes 36 muffins.
      Note: You can use muffin  cups  instead  of a pan.  You will need to bake for 20  minutes  and  it  will  only make 12 muffins.
