CHEESE STRAWS


1  lb. sharp cheddar, finely shredded
1 1/2  c. all purpose flour
1/4  c. butter, softened
1/8 - 1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper (to taste)

      Put 8 oz. cheddar in processor or blender, and turn on.  Add 1/2 of flour, butter, and pepper.  Process all ingredients in food processor until mixture forms a ball.  Then add rest of ingredients a little at a time.
      Using a cookie press and spritz cookie disk, follow manufacturer's instructions and press out onto ungreased baking sheet.  (You may also roll these and cut them, but you may need to add just a few drops of milk if mixture is too dry.  But be careful or it will get too sticky.)  If you like them salty, sprinkle liberally with salt before baking.
      Bake at 375 degrees; for 12 minutes or until lightly browned.
      Yield:  About 8 dozen.  (Recipe can be halved.)
