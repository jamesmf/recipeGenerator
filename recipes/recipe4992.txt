GREEN BEAN SOUP
(German)  

  3-4 cans green beans (do not drain)
6  slices bacon
2  Tbsp. flour
1  medium onion
6  medium potatoes
  3-4 tsp. chicken paste or bouillon cubes to taste
  Maggi liquid seasoning (if available)
  Salt and pepper to taste

      In a stockpot peel potatoes, and cut into bite size pieces. Bring potatoes to a boil. Cut bacon and onion into tiny pieces. Add to separate skillet, simmer until bacon is pretty done and onions are clear. Remove bacon and onions, leaving liquid.  Add flour (more or less depending on how thick you want soup to be), making a roux.  When potatoes are done, add roux and chicken paste or bouillon cubes, and green beans to stockpot of boiling potatoes.  Season with small amount of Maggi and/or salt and pepper.
