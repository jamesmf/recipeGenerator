CHOCOLATE TAFFY


1  c. water
2  sq. unsweetened grated chocolate
1  c. sugar
1  c. molasses
2  Tbsp. butter
1/2  tsp. vanilla

      Cook water, chocolate, sugar, molasses and butter together until the syrup forms a soft ball when dropped into cold water. Add vanilla and pour into a buttered pan to cool and harden.  When stiff, mark off in squares with a knife.  When cold and brittle, break off on marked squares.
