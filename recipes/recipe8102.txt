	Cook the chicken in boiling water until tender, about 25 minutes.  Shred chicken and set aside.  In a separate container, soak the crust-less bread in the milk.  Add the chili powder and mix.  Place the onion in a skillet with oil and saut√©.  When the oil comes to a boil add the salt, cumin, coriander, and pepper to taste.  Cook the mixture for a while.  Then add the soaked bread, mashed smooth.  Next add the shredded chicken and the grated cheese.  Simmer for 20 minutes covered, checking to see that the mixture does not burn.
