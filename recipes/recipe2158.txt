8  oz. soft cream cheese
1/4  tsp. vanilla
  dash of salt
1 1/2 to 2 1/2  c. sifted 10x sugar
7  oz. pkg. sweetened coconut

      Mix all ingredients but coconut.  Blend well.  Refrigerate until firm.  Mold into small balls and roll in coconut until lightly covered.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.  Coconut may be tinted.
      Note:  1 1/2 cups sugar gives cheesecake taste; 2 1/2 cups sugar gives bonbon candy taste.
