HAMBURGER SOUP


1 1/2  lb. ground beef
1  medium onion
1  (28 oz.) tomatoes
2  c. water
3  cans beef consomme
1  can tomato soup
4  carrots, chopped fine
3  stalks celery, chopped fine
1  bay leaf
1/2  tsp. thyme
8  Tbsp. barley

      Brown meat and onion; drain well.  Combine all ingredients and simmer, covered, for 2 to 4 hours.
      I have substituted ground turkey and chicken broth and it is wonderful.
