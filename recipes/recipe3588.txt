THE MOUNTAIN DIP
(Nacho Style)  

1  lb. lean ground beef
1 (8 oz.)  jar medium salsa, divided
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. garlic
1/4  tsp. onion salt
1/8  tsp. pepper
1 (16 oz.)  can refried beans
1 1/2  c. shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/2  c. shredded Monterey Jack cheese
  chopped tomatoes
  sliced green onions
  sliced black olives
  sour cream
  guacamole
  tortilla or corn chips

      How to Microwave the Mountain: Crumble beef into 2-quart casserole dish. Stir in 1/2 cup of salsa, onion salt, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Cover. Microwave on High for 4 to 6 minutes, or until beef is no longer pink, stirring once or twice to break apart. Drain; stir in remaining 1/2 cup salsa and beans. On a platter, mound mixture into a rounded shape, about 9-inches.
      Mix cheeses together.  Sprinkle over meat and bean mixture, covering completely.  Microwave at 50% (Medium) power for 7 to 10 minutes until cheese melts.  Rotate platter after every 2 minutes. Sprinkle tomatoes, onions and olives in center of cheese. Alternate dollops of sour cream and guacamole around edge of platter.  Serve with chips.  Very easy to do and GOOD.
