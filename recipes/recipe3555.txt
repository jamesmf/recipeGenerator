JACK BREAD/FRENCH BREAD


1  French-bread large loaf
4  oz. Monterey Jack cheese
8  oz. Swiss cheese
8  oz. Cheddar cheese
6  oz. Colby cheese
4  oz. Mozzarella cheese
  dash of Worcestershire sauce
1/2  c. green onion, diced

	Combine all cheeses.  Mix with 1/2 cup green onions and dash of Worcestershire sauce.  Add enough mayonnaise to make a spreading consistency.  Cut loaf of bread in half lengthwise.  Remove enough of the inside to make room for cheese spread.  Place halves on baking pan or cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees; until cheese is bubbly and bread is crusty and brown.
