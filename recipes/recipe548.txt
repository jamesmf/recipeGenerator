PASTE


1  c. sugar
1  c. flour
1  qt. cold water
1  Tbsp. alum
1  tsp. oil of cloves

      Combine sugar, flour and water in top of double boiler; cook until thickened, stirring often.  To preserve paste, add alum and oil of cloves.  Seal in jars.  Paste will set to stiffer consistency.  Lasts indefinitely if kept sealed.
