Grilled Garlic Shrimp



2  lb. large unshelled shrimp, deveined
1/2  c. melted, unsalted butter
1/2  c. olive oil
1  Tbsp. minced shallots or green onions
3 large peeled  cloves garlic
1  tsp. salt
1 1/2  Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
1/4  c. minced parsley
  salt and freshly ground pepper
  parsley sprigs (garnish)

      Wash shrimp in cold water and dry well.  Pour butter and olive oil into a 3-quart shallow bowl.  Add shallots.  Chop garlic with salt on a cutting board (this helps eliminate the strong garlic aftertaste).  Add garlic and salt mixture to bowl.  Roll shrimp in this mixture until well coated.  Sprinkle with lemon juice and parsley.  Marinate at least 30 minutes, turning shrimp several times.
      Place shrimp on gas grill over medium flame and grill 5 to 7 minutes on each side, depending on size of shrimp.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Serve in individual dishes and spoon heated marinade over them.  Garnish with parsley.  Yield:  6 servings.
