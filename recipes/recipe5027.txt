VEGETABLE BEEF SOUP


1  lb. stew meat, cut in small pieces
7  c. water
2  Tbsp. dried parsley
  Salt to taste
2 (16 oz.)  cans tomatoes and 2 8-oz. cans tomato sauce
1  can Rotel
1  onion, chopped
  1-1 1/2 c. fresh carrots, chopped
1  can LeSueur peas
1 1/2  c. frozen corn
3/4  c. barley
1  can butter beans

      Flour stew meat and brown in oil.  In large pot on stove, put water, parsley, salt, and stew meat, cover and simmer one hour.
      Add tomatoes, sauce, Rotel, onion and carrots, cover and simmer for another hour.   Add peas, corn, barley, and butter beans or whatever vegetable you prefer.  Cover and simmer 1 hr. (I usually add another can of tomatoes and another can of tomato sauce if I think I need it.)
