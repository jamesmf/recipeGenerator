COLOMBIAN FRESH BANANA CAKE
(With Seafoam Frosting)  
Cake:
1 (18 1/2 oz.)  pkg. yellow cake mix
1/8  tsp. baking soda
2  eggs
3/4  c. Coca-Cola
1  c. (2 to 3) mashed ripe bananas
2  tsp. lemon juice
1/3  c. finely chopped nuts (optional)

      In large mixing bowl, combine mix, baking soda and eggs. Measure Coca-Cola.  Stir briskly until foaming stops and add to batter.  Blend ingredients just until moistened, then beat at high speed of electric mixer for 3 minutes, scraping bowl often. Combine mashed bananas with lemon juice.  Add to cake batter with nuts.  Beat 1 minute at medium speed and turn into a generously greased and lightly floured 13 x 9 x 2-inch pan.  Bake at 350 degrees; about 40 minutes or until cake tests done.  Cool on rack 15 minutes.  Remove cake from pan and turn right side upon rack to finish cooling.
      Do not use mix with pudding added or which requires oil.
Seafoam Frosting:
2  egg whites (1/4 c.)
1 1/2  c. firmly packed light brown sugar
  dash of salt
1/8  tsp. cream of tartar or 1 Tbsp. light corn syrup
1/3  c. Coca-Cola
1  tsp. vanilla extract

      In top of double boiler, combine all ingredients, except vanilla, and beat 1 minute at high speed of electric mixer.  Place over boiling water (water should not touch bottom of top part); beat on high speed about 7 minutes, until frosting forms peaks when beater is raised.  Remove from boiling water (for smoothest frosting, empty into large bowl).  Add vanilla and continue beating on high speed until thick enough to spread, about 2 minutes. Spread on sides and top of cold banana cake.
