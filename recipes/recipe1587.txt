BAKED BANANAS


1/2  c. fresh orange juice
1/2  c. white wine
1/4  c. honey
1 1/2  tsp. grated orange rind
1/4  tsp. cinnamon
1/4  tsp. nutmeg
6  medium bananas
1/4  c. finely chopped almonds (optional)
2  Tbsp. margarine (optional)

      In a small saucepan, combine juice, wine, honey, orange rind, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Heat until warm.  Peel bananas and split them in half lengthwise.  Place bananas, cut side down, in a greased baking dish large enough to accommodate the bananas without crowding them.  Pour sauce over bananas.  Sprinkle with almonds and dot with margarine, if desired.  Bake in a 350 degrees; oven for a total of 25 minutes, basting bananas with sauce after the first 15 minutes of baking.
