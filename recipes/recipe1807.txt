SWISS HOLIDAY BREAD


1  pkg. dry yeast
1  c. milk
1/4  c. sugar
1/4  c. butter
1  tsp. salt
1  egg
  flour
1/3  c. diced, preserved citron
1  egg, beaten (for glaze)
1  c. chopped, seeded raisins
1/2  c. unblanched almonds, chopped
1/4  c. mixed red and green maraschino cherries, drained and halved
1/2  tsp. grated lemon rind

      Sprinkle the yeast into 2 1/4 cups warm water.  Stir until dissolved.  Scald the milk and pour into large bowl.  Stir in the sugar, butter and salt and let sit until lukewarm.  Beat in 2 cups of flour, then the yeast, egg and enough extra flour to make a soft dough (1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups).  Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface.  Cover with a towel and let it stand for 10 minutes.  Knead until smooth, about 10 minutes.  Place in a lightly greased bowl, turning it once to grease the whole surface.  Cover and leave to rise in a warm place (80 degrees; to 85 degrees;) until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.  Punch the dough and let it rise again until it doubles in size.  Punch it down and using hands, work in the citron, raisins, almonds, cherries and lemon rind.  Divide the dough in half; shape into two loaves and put into greased 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pans.  Let rise until almost doubled in bulk, about 30 to 40 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees;.  Brush the loaves with the beaten egg, then bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until they sound hollow when tapped with the finger.  Remove the loaves from the pans and cool on a rack.
