SPIDER CAKE


1  pkg. chocolate cake mix
16  oz. ready-to-spread chocolate frosting
  black paste food color
8  (12-inch) black bump chenille (thick and thin) pipe cleaners
1/2  pair vampire's teeth
2  plastic cat's eyes
  red ready-to-pipe gel

      Prepare cake mix and bake in two 8-inch pans, following package directions.  When cakes have been removed from pans, let stand on cooling racks at least 2 hours to firm up for easier frosting. Empty container of frosting into medium-sized bowl.  Beat with electric mixer until smooth.  Gradually beat in black food color, 1/4 teaspoon at a time, until icing is almost black (color darkens upon standing).  Place cake on serving plate.  Spread frosting between layers and on top and sides of cake, smoothing out the sharp edge and rounding top slightly.
      Bend pipe cleaners in half, then bend one end of each to form feet.  Insert 4 on opposite sides of cake to form legs.  Slide vampire teeth between layers and place cat's eyes to form face. Pipe red gel on teeth to look like dripping blood.  Eat fast before it eats you!
