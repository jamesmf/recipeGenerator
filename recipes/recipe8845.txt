DRIP BEEF ON BUNS


5  lb. boneless rump roast (lean)
1  Tbsp. garlic salt
1/2  tsp. oregano
2  beef bouillon cubes
1/2  tsp. rosemary
1  pkg. au jus mix
1  Tbsp. minced onion
3/4  Tbsp. seasoned salt
1  pkg. wheatberry rolls

      Remove excess fat; the leaner, the better. Place in Dutch oven or crock-pot. Put in seasonings; barely cover with water and simmer 8 to 10 hours covered in slow oven. When done, lift meat to platter; shred with fork and return to pot. Serve on warm buns. Serves 12.
