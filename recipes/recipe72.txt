CHOCOLATE COVERED BANANAS


6  to 8 large size bananas, cut in half
2/3  c. vegetable shortening
1 (12 oz.) or 2 (6 oz.)  pkg. semi-sweet chocolate chips

      You will need 12 to 16 wooden sticks.
      Place wooden sticks in peeled bananas that are cut in halves. Place on waxed paper covered cookie sheet and freeze overnight. Cover with waxed paper or place in plastic bag.  Melt shortening and chocolate in double boiler over hot, not boiling, water. Remove from heat and place or dip bananas in hot chocolate. Chocolate will harden almost immediately on frozen bananas.  Place on waxed paper covered cookie sheet and place each banana in plastic bag; re-freeze.
