VEGETABLE BEEF SOUP


1  lb. ground beef
2  large onions, chopped
3  medium potatoes, chopped
1  Tbsp. salt
1/2  tsp. pepper
1  stick margarine
10  oz. pkg. frozen peas
10  oz. pkg. frozen carrots
10  oz. pkg. frozen corn
10  oz. pkg. frozen lima beans
64  oz. tomato juice or 15 oz. tomato sauce
1 large  can tomatoes
3 to 4  c. water
1/4  c. sugar (if desired)

      Saut ground beef in large Dutch oven until browned, stirring to separate. Drain off fat. Add remaining ingredients and simmer, covered, for 45 minutes or until all vegetables are very tender. Any leftover meat, vegetables or pasta may be added, if desired.
       (Do not use potatoes if freezing the soup.) Great served with cornbread!
