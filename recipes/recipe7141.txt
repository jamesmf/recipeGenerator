PORK CUTLETS


1-1/2  lbs pork tenderloins
1  c flour
3  eggs, beaten
1  c plain bread crumbs
1/4  c olive oil
1  tbsp butter

      Cut tenderloins crosswise into 1 inch rounds.  Pound the pieces gently between sheets of plastic wrap until they are thin cutlets.  Dredge each piece in flour then water, then eggs, then bread crumbs.  Refrigerate for 1 hour to keep the breading on better when frying.  Heat the oil in a skillet over moderate heat. Add butter.  Fry the cutlets a few at a time until they are golden brown.  Put a rack in the bottom of a roasting pan, then crumple aluminum foil on top of the rack.  Place the cutlets on top of the foil.  Add 1 cup water to the bottom of the pan.  Cover tightly with foil.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 40 minutes.
