      Melt butter in pan.  Add flour and mix thoroughly.  Heat for one minute.  Remove from heat.  Add milk and boil for 10 minutes, stirring vigorously, until thick.  Remove again from heat and blend in egg yolks, then add cheese, salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Pour mixture on rectangular baking tin until about 5/8-inch thick. Flatten and let stand 6 to 7 hours.  Next day, mix milk with eggs. From cold mixture, cut rectangular pieces about 2 1/3 x 5/8-inches in size and mold into rolls.  Turn rolls in flour.  Dip into egg milk and roll in bread crumbs, then deep-fry.  May be served with fresh tomato sauce with it.
