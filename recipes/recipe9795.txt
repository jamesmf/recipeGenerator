NAVAJO TACOS


1  loaf frozen white bread dough, thawed

 
Filling:
1  lb. ground beef
1  lb. hot bulk pork sausage
1  pkg. (1 - 1 1/4 ounces) taco seasoning
1  can (15 ounces) pinto beans drained and rinsed
1/2  cup water
  cooking oil
  chopped tomato
  finely chopped onion
  shredded lettuce
  shredded cheddar cheese
  taco sauce

      Allow dough to rise.  Meanwhile, for filling, brown ground beef and sausage in a skillet; drain.  Stir in taco seasoning, beans and water.  Simmer 15 to 20 minutes or until the water is almost evaporated; set aside.  After dough rises, punch down. Make tortillas by dividing dough into 10 to 12 equal balls.  Using a small amount of flour, roll each ball into a 8 inch circle (tortillas should be thin).  Fry each tortilla in 1/4 inch of hot oil until golden, turning once.  Drain tortillas on paper towels; keep warm.  Top each tortilla with meat mixture, tomato, onion, lettuce, cheese, and taco sauce.  Yield: 10 -12 servings.
