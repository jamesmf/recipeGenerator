SHRIMP SUNOMONO
(Japanese-Style Salad)  

6  oz. tiny Pacific shrimp
1/2  c. white vinegar
1  Tbsp. sesame oil
1/2  c. sugar
2  tsp. salt
1  tsp. monosodium glutamate
1  cucumber, thinly sliced
3  stalks celery, diagonally sliced
2  green onions, minced

      Rinse shrimp with cold water; pat dry with paper towels.  Set aside.  Combine vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, salt and monosodium glutamate; mix well.  Refrigerate dressing for at least 1 hour before serving to allow flavors to blend.  Combine shrimp, cucumber, celery and green onion.  Pour dressing over shrimp and vegetable mixture just before serving; toss.  Makes 4 servings.
      For a light entree, increase shrimp to 1 pound.
