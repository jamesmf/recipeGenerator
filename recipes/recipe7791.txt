COUNTRY HAM WITH RED-EYE GRAVY


3  (1/4 to 1/2-inch thick) country ham slices
1/4  c. butter or margarine
1  c. strong brewed coffee
1/4  c. light brown sugar

      Make cuts in fat to keep ham from curling.  Melt butter over low heat in a heavy skillet.  Add ham and cook 5 minutes on each side until light brown.  Remove from skillet and keep warm.  Stir brown sugar into hot drippings until dissolved, if brown sugar is desired.  Add coffee; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes.
