CHICKEN ENCHILADA CASSEROLE


4  chicken breasts, cooked and chopped up
3  or 4 flour tortillas, soft taco size, cut into 1-inch wide strips
1  can green enchilada sauce
1 (8 oz.)  pkg. cream cheese
1  (8 oz.) container sour cream
1  can diced ortega chilies (these are very mild)
8  oz. shredded Monterey Jack or Mexican blend cheese

      In the microwave, soften the cream cheese.  Stir in the green enchilada sauce, the sour cream and the diced ortega chilies.  Stir in 1/2 of the grated cheese.  The ingredients are going to be assembled in layers similar to lasagna-sauce, chicken, tortilla strips.  In an 8 x 8 x 2-inch deep casserole dish, spoon in some of the sauce, enough to lightly cover the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle chicken pieces over the sauce.  Cover the chicken with strips of tortilla and start the process again.  Leave enough sauce for the top layer (if you have any extra, just pour it on). Sprinkle the rest of the cheese over the top of the casserole and bake in a 350 degrees; oven for 30 minutes or until the cheese begins to brown.
      Makes 4-6 servings.  When serving, top with a dollop of sour cream.
