CRANBERRY SOUFFLE


1 (1 lb.)  can whole cranberry sauce
1  pkg. lemon-flavored gelatin
1  c. hot water
1/2  c. Hellmann's real mayonnaise
1 1/2  oz. cream cheese (half 3 oz. pkg.)
1  Tbsp. lemon juice
1/4  tsp. salt
2  oranges, diced
1/4  c. chopped pecans or walnuts
1/2  c. chopped celery

      Dissolve gelatin in hot water.  Heat cranberry sauce until melted.  Then, strain off 1/2 cup juice, adding it to dissolved gelatin.  Next, blend together mayonnaise and cream cheese and add to gelatin mixture with lemon juice and salt.  Blend thoroughly. Turn into freezing tray and chill until firm 1-inch in from edge but soft in center (20 to 25 minutes).  Turn into bowl and whip until fluffy.  Fold in remaining cranberry sauce, diced oranges, nuts and celery.  Pour into molds and chill until firm (about 1 hour).  Unmold; garnish with salad greens and top with Hellmann's real mayonnaise.
