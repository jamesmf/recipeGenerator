BLOOMIN' ONION CHRYSANTHEMUMS


6  onions (at least 4-inches in diameter)
  vegetable oil (for deep-frying)

 
Seasoned Flour:
2  c. flour
4  tsp. paprika
2  tsp. garlic powder
1/2  tsp. black pepper
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper

 
Batter:
3  c. cornstarch
1 1/2  c. flour
2  tsp. garlic salt
2  tsp. paprika
1  tsp. salt and pepper
24  oz. club soda

 
Dipping Sauce:
2  c. mayonnaise
2  c. sour cream
1/2  c. chili sauce
1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper

      Combine Seasoned Flour ingredients in a bowl.
      In another bowl, combine Batter ingredients, stirring frequently.
      Cut about 3/4-inch from the top of each onion, then cut onions into 12 to 16 vertical wedges, but do not cut through the root end. Dip the cut onion in Seasoned Flour and shake to remove excess flour.  Separate petals and coat well with Batter.  Deep-fry in vegetable oil heated to 375 degrees; to 400 degrees; for 1 1/2 minutes; turn over and fry 1 1/2 minutes longer or until golden brown all over.  Serve in shallow bowl with center onion core removed.
      Combine the sauce ingredients and warm over low heat, stirring with a whisk.  Serve Dipping Sauce with the onions.  Serves 18 to 20.  Great for a large family gathering.
