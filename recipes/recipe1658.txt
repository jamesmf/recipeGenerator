3  c. water
1/2  head cauliflower
1/4  c. flour

  ground nutmeg
  chopped parsley
  croutons
1  chicken bouillon cube
3  Tbsp. butter

      Place the water and bouillon cube in a saucepan and heat until the bouillon cube dissolves.  Break the cauliflower into flowerets and cook in the bouillon until tender.  Remove the cauliflower and select about 8 flowerets which are most intact and set aside.  Chop or puree the remainder.  Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the flour, stirring constantly.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then add the cauliflower puree and the cooking liquid.  Stirring constantly, add the milk or cream, salt and nutmeg.  Simmer 3 to 5 minutes.  Add the cheese and the reserved flowerets.  Serve in individual dishes. Sprinkle with chives, parsley, dill and croutons before serving.
