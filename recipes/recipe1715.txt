JAPANESE CREPES


40  grams flour
50  grams sugar
1  egg
100  cc./ml. milk
15  grams melted butter

      Sift dry ingredients; add egg and milk and mix well.  Add melted butter.  Cover the bottom of a smooth frying pan with oil. Add a very thin layer of batter, just covering the bottom of the pan.  Don't cook to brownness, but before it gets brown flip the very slim pancake so the other side can cook; then remove and either let cool or not.  To eat, add butter, jam, chocolate, ice cream, rolled up in it.  Makes 5 crepes.
