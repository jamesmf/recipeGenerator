RIBBON SALAD


1  pkg. each: lime, lemon, orange and red jello (small pkg.)
2  c. milk
1  c. sugar
1  pt. sour cream
2  pkg. unflavored gelatin (2 envelopes)
2  tsp. vanilla

      Dissolve each package of jello in 1 cup boiling water separately*.  Add 1/2 cup cold water to each.  Put lemon jello in a 9 x 13-inch pan.  Refrigerate 35 to 45 minutes.  Boil milk and add sugar; dissolve gelatin in 1/2 cup of cold water, then add to milk mixture.  Add vanilla to sour cream, then add to milk mixture.  Blend well with mixer (this is white).  Add 1 1/2 cups white mixture to pan of lemon jello after jello has set up firm. Refrigerate and set.  Add orange - set, 1 1/2 cups white mixture - set, lime - set, white - set and red - set.  Be sure to stir white mixture a little before measuring each 1 1/2 cups.
      *Mix together next jello layer after putting white layer on to set.  This gives jello time to cool before adding.
