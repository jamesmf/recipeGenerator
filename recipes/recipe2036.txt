BRIGADEIROS
(Candy From Brazil)  

1 (14 1/2 oz.)  can Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk
2  Tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder
1  Tbsp. butter
1/3  c. chocolate flavored sprinkles

      In a 2-quart saucepan, combine condensed milk, cocoa powder and butter.  Cook and stir over medium heat about 5 minutes or until mixture forms a ball around the spoon and pulls away from sides of pan.  Turn mixture out onto buttered plate to cool.  When cool enough to handle, butter hands and form mixture into one-inch balls.  Roll in chocolate sprinkles.  Cover and chill in refrigerator.  Makes approximately 2 dozen.
