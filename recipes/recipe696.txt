BROCCOLI AND ZUCCHINI PASTA


1  head broccoli, separated into florets
1 (8 oz.)  pkg. spaghetti or ziti
5  cloves fresh garlic
1  zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/4  c. olive oil
1  tsp. dried oregano
  salt and pepper to taste
1/4  c. butter or margarine
1/2  c. Parmesan cheese

      Steam broccoli in a small amount of water or in a steamer basket until crisp-tender, about 7 minutes.  Meanwhile, cook spaghetti.  Make a sauce by stir-frying garlic and zucchini in oil until zucchini is barely tender.  Add oregano and salt and pepper. Melt butter into sauce, then add broccoli.  Toss sauce with spaghetti and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Serve immediately. Yields 6 to 8 servings.
