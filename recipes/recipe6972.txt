EASY CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS


4  or more chicken quarters
1  can cream of chicken soup
2  c. of Bisquick mix
  milk
  salt, to taste
  black pepper, to taste
  parsley flakes

      Remove any excess fat from chicken quarters. Cover chicken with water and boil approximately 20-30 minutes or until done. (Do not over cook or meat will become stringy.) Remove chicken from pot and cool; remove skin and debone; set aside. Add cream of chicken soup to chicken broth and stir.
       Mix 2 c. Bisquick with a small amount of milk. The dough should stick together but will look very dry. Roll dough into small balls. (if dough is too sticky, add more Bisquick until you can roll it in your hands.) Flatten the ball very thin, one at a time, pinch off small pieces and drop into simmering broth. Drop all the dumplings into the pot, stirring occasionally. Then, season with salt and black pepper. (Use lots of black pepper, this is one of the secrets to making delicious dumplings.)
      After dumplings have been added to pot, simmer for about 10 minutes; you may need to add more water to pot if broth is too thick; add deboned chicken. Stir and let it heat through. Add parsley flakes, stir and remove from heat. Cover and allow to set for at least 10 minutes. Adjust seasoning if necessary. A favorite at any gathering!
      Tip: If you must reheat before serving, use a low heat and stir as dumplings dishes have a tendency to stick to bottom of pot.
