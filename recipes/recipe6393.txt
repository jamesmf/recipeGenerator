CHERRY TOMATO SALAD


2  pt. cherry tomatoes, stemmed and halved and thinly sliced lengthwise
4  scallions (white parts only), thinly sliced
4  large Belgian endives

 
Dressing:
1  large egg yolk
1  Tbsp. chopped fresh parsley leaves
1  Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
1  Tbsp. Dijon mustard
1/2  c. olive oil
1  Tbsp. finely chopped shallots
1/2  c. vegetable oil
1 1/2  Tbsp. red wine vinegar
1  Tbsp. chopped fresh basil or 1 tsp. dried basil
  salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

      Put the tomatoes and scallions into a bowl. To mix the dressing, beat the egg yolk, lemon juice, mustard, shallots and herbs in a bowl for 15 seconds, using a wire whisk. Drop by drop whisk in the olive oil and the vegetable oil. Add the vinegar and salt and pepper to taste and combine well. Pour the dressing over the tomatoes and scallions and toss gently.
       Cut the ends off the endives and separate them into individual leaves. Arrange the endive leaves, inner parts of leaves facing up, around the edge of a large shallow salad bowl and spoon the salad mixture into the center.
