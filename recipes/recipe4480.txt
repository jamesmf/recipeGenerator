REAL TEXAS CHILI


3  lb. boneless chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes
2  Tbsp. vegetable oil
2 to 3  cloves garlic, chopped
3  Tbsp. chili powder (1/2 as much if you don't want it too hot)
1  tsp. ground cumin
3  Tbsp. flour
1  Tbsp. leaf oregano
2  cans beef broth (13 3/4 oz.)
1  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
1 (15 oz.)  can pinto beans (optional)
1  c. sour cream (optional)
1  lime, cut into wedges (optional)

      Heat oil in 4-quart kettle over medium heat. Add beef, stirring frequently with wooden spoon, until meat changes color but does not brown. Lower heat; stir in garlic. Combine chili powder, cumin seed and flour. Sprinkle meat with chili mixture, stirring until meat is evenly coated. Crumble oregano over meat. Add 1 1/2 cans broth and stir until liquid is blended. Add salt and pepper. Bring to boil and stir occasionally. Reduce heat for 1 1/2 hours and stir occasionally. Add remaining broth and cook 30 minutes longer until meat almost falls apart. Cool thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate overnight to ripen flavor. Reheat chili in top part of double boiler.
      OPTIONAL: Heat beans and drain. Stir in chili. Garnish chili with sour cream. Use wedges of lime to squeeze over each portion.
