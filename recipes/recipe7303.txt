ORIENTAL CHICKEN


  boneless skinless chicken
  apples
  almonds
  bell peppers
  onions
  salt
  black pepper
  curry powder
  cinnamon
  cloves
  soy sauce
  olive oil (not over 1 Tbsp.)
  water (enough to cover)

      You may add any vegetables that you like. You may substitute beef or seafood for chicken. Please use the cloves and curry powder sparingly (they are very strong).
      Combine all ingredients in a large skillet in moderation and simmer until the meat is done and the vegetables are tender. Prepare 1 package of saffron yellow rice in a separate pot. Serve the meat and vegetable mixture over the rice.
