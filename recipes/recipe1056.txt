AFRICAN STEW WITH OKRA


1  onion, chopped
1  green bell pepper, deseeded
2  cloves garlic
1/4  c. chopped parsley
5  large ripe tomatoes, peeled
3  Tbsp. vegetable oil
1 1/2  lb. lamb or beef, cut into bite-sized pieces
1  lb. okra, trimmed
  salt and black pepper to taste

      In a blender or food processor puree the onion, green pepper, garlic, parsley and tomatoes; set aside.  Heat the oil in a saucepan and brown the meat on all sides.  Add the tomato mixture to the meat.  If puree seems too thick, add a little water or stock.  Cover and simmer until the meat is tender and done.  Add the okra and cook for 30 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper. Serves 4.
