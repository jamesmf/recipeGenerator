1  lb. chicken breasts, boned and skinned
2  Tbsp. Olive oil
1  pkg. Taco seasoning mix
1  onion, finely chopped
1  clove garlic, minced
1 (15 oz.)  can stewed tomatoes
1 (4 oz.)  can green chilies, chopped
2  c. water
1 (8 oz.)  can or jar mild green chili salsa
1 (15 oz.)  can black beans
1 (15 oz.)  can pinto beans

      Season chicken to taste and broil in oven until done.  Remove meat; cool and shred with a fork.  (Chicken may be covered with water and boiled on stove until done if preferred.  Remove from water; cool and shred with a fork.)  In a large skillet, combine shredded chicken, olive oil, taco seasoning, onions, and garlic. Cook until onions are clear.  While cooking chicken mixture, combine all the remaining ingredients in a pot and heat.  When skillet mixture is done, add to the pot and heat thoroughly.  Serve soup with cheese and chips or corn bread.
