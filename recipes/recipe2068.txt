PEPPERMINT TAFFY


1  c. sugar
2/3  c. water
2  Tbsp. butter
1  Tbsp. peppermint extract
3/4  c. light corn syrup
1  Tbsp. cornstarch
1  tsp. salt
8 to 10  drops red food coloring

      Grease 2 baking pans (8 x 8 x 2-inches) with butter or margarine.  Heat all ingredients, except extract and coloring, to just boiling in saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly. Cook, without stirring, to 256 degrees; on candy thermometer (about 30 minutes).  Remove from heat and add peppermint extract.  Pour half the mixture into a pan.  Add food coloring to the other half of mixture and pour in the other pan.  Let cool about 15 minutes, until cool in center.  Fold, double and pull each color of taffy until stiff and light in color.  Pull each color into long strips and twist together.  Cut into 1 to 3-inch sections with scissors and wrap with wax paper.  (Taffy will lose its shape if not wrapped.)
