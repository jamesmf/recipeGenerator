CHINESE NOODLE SALAD

Part 1:
1  medium head nappa cabbage or bok choy, torn or cut into pieces
5  green onions (tops and all), completely chopped

 
Part 2:
2  pkg. Ramen noodles, crumbled
1/2  c. butter
1  pkg. slivered almonds (2/3 c.)

      Brown in a skillet and cool. Don't let this get too brown.
Part 3:
3/4  c. salad oil
3/4  c. sugar
1/4  c. vinegar
2 to 3  Tbsp. soy sauce

      Mix all ingredients together in a jar for the dressing.
       Toss all 3 parts together about 20 minutes before serving.
      You can make smaller servings by keeping each part separate and mix whatever amount you need. So easy and convenient to have on hand. Enjoy!
