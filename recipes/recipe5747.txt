HAMBURG SOUP


1  lb. hamburg
1  medium onion, chopped
1 small  can tomato paste
4 1/2  c. water
2  cans cream of celery soup
2  c. raw or canned carrots
1/4  tsp. garlic
1/4  tsp. marjoram

      Brown hamburg and onion.  Add remaining ingredients.  If using canned carrots, use liquid as part of the water amount.  If using fresh carrots, cook separately until tender.  Simmer 1/2 hour.
      If you prefer a thicker soup, reduce water to 3 cups.
