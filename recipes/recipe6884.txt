MOM'S RED BEANS AND SAUSAGE


1  lb. dried red beans
1  onion, chopped fine
1/2  bell pepper, chopped fine
2  to 3 onion tops, chopped
1/2  tsp. parsley flakes
1/2  tsp. garlic, minced
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper
1  link smoked sausage, cut up
1  bay leaf (if wanted)
  salt to taste

	Sort and wash beans and then rewash to make sure they are clean. Fill pot with water and boil. While beans are boiling, fry sausage, onions, bell peppers, onion tops and parsley together until tender or just brown around the edges. Once this is done and your beans are starting to split open, combine everything together in the pot. Now add the bay leaf and the garlic. As you stir the beans, smash the beans on the side of the pot for creamy ones. Cook until sauce is thick and beans are tender. Remove bay leaf before you serve.
