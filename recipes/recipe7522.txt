SAUSAGE AND EGG BREAKFAST PIZZA


1  pkg. (12- to 16-oz.) ground pork sausage
1  can (8.5-oz.) refrigerated crescent rolls
1  c. frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
1  c. (4-oz.) shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
3  eggs, lightly beaten
3  Tbsp. milk
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. pepper
3  Tbsp. each diced red and yellow bell pepper (optional)
1/4  c. thinly sliced green onions (optional)
2  Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese

      Preheat oven to 375 degrees;.  In large skillet, cook sausage over medium-high heat, stirring frequently until no longer pink. Separate crescent rolls into 8 triangles.  Place in ungreased 12-inch rimmed pizza pan with points toward the center.  Press together, seal perforations and form a circle 1-inch larger in diameter than pan bottom.  Turn edges under to make a slight rim. Sprinkle cooked sausage over crust.  Top with potatoes.  Add peppers and/or green onions if desired.  Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.  Stir eggs, milk, salt, and pepper in small bowl; pour evenly over pizza.  Sprinkle with Parmesan.  Bake 20 minutes or until eggs are set and crust is golden.  Serve immediately.
