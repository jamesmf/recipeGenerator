BURRITO DE MANZANA
(Apple-Filled Tortillas)  

6  large flour tortillas
3  apples
1/2  c. sugar
1  tsp. cinnamon

      Peel and cut apples into small pieces.  Mix apples, sugar and cinnamon together.  Warm tortillas until they are soft and flexible.  Put a large heaping spoonful at one end of the tortilla and roll, folding in the ends.  Close with a toothpick.  Deep fry burrito until golden brown.  Drain on paper towel.  Sprinkle with sugar and serve warm.  This can be done with other pie mixtures, too.
