BARBECUE CHICKEN PIZZA



1  Boboli Italian Pizza crust, 12 inch
1 6  oz. pkg. Louis Rich Grilled Chicken Breast Strips
1/3  c. Kraft Original Barbecue Sauce
1  green pepper, cut into strips
1  small red onion, thinly sliced
1 8  oz. pkg. Kraft Natural Shredded Mozzarella and Cheddar Pizza Cheese

      Place pizza crust on ungreased cookie sheet.  Toss chicken with barbecue sauce; place evenly on crust.  Top with peppers, onion and cheese.  Bake at 450 degrees on bottom oven rack for 10 to 12 minutes or until cheese is melted and pizza crust is golden brown.  Makes 4 to 6 servings.
      Tip:  For a crispier crust, bake pizza directly on oven rack.
