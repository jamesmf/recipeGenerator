1  large onion, diced
2  Tbsp. Crisco or oleo
4  to 6 bouillon cubes (chicken flavored)
5  Tbsp. flour
1  c. sour cream
3  c. hot water

	In a pot, brown chicken in Crisco or oleo. Add onion and paprika. Saut√© until tender. Dissolve bouillon cubes in 3 cups hot water and pour into chicken pot. Boil chicken until tender. Take chicken out of liquid and debone. (Make sure you always have 3 cups of water in your pot; add if necessary.) Bring water back to boiling. Mix flour with approximately 3/4 cup of water. Stir in boiling liquid to make gravy. Add sour cream and deboned chicken.
Dumplings:
2 1/2  c. all-purpose flour
4  eggs, well beaten
1/2  c. milk
1/2  c. water
1  tsp. salt
1  pinch of baking powder

	Mix ingredients. Start water to boil. Drop dumplings in boiling water, a teaspoon at a time. Take out of water when dumplings pop up to the top. Drain in a colander, then put them back into the chicken pot. Dumplings tend to stick to the bottom of pan; take a fork and gently loosen them. Don't overcook.
