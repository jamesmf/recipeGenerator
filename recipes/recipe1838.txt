HEARTY SPANISH SOUP


2  lb. beef shanks
3  qt. water
2  cloves garlic
1  onion, sliced
8  peppercorns
3  carrots, sliced
3  zucchini, sliced
1/2  lb. green beans, cut up
  salt to taste
3  ears of corn (fresh or frozen), cut into 1-inch pieces

      Start the meat in cold water.  Make a rich broth by cooking it slowly with garlic, onion, pepper and salt.  When the meat is tender, strain off broth.  Add the vegetables (corn last) and cook slowly until done.  Add the meat, cut in cubes, to the soup.  If extra piquancy is desired, you may serve this with jalapeno sauce. Pick the corn up with fingers.
