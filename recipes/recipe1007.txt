SOUR CREAM CUCUMBER SOUP


3  medium cucumbers
1/2  c. chopped onions
2  Tbsp. butter
1  Tbsp. flour
2  c. rich chicken broth
1  tsp. seasoned salt
1 1/2  c. dairy sour cream
3/4  Tbsp. lemon juice
1/8  tsp. dried dill

      Pare and slice 2 cucumbers (about 3 cups).  Cook with onions in butter until soft.  Stir in flour; add broth slowly.  Cover; simmer until cucumbers are tender, about 10 minutes.  Cool slightly; add seasoned salt.  Whirl smooth in blender or processor.  Chill well. Pare remaining cucumber and scoop out seeds.  Grate the cucumber medium coarse.  Add to chilled soup base along with sour cream. Blend in lemon juice and dill.
      The base can be made ahead and placed in refrigerator.  At the last minute add grated cucumber, sour cream, lemon and dill.  Makes about 1 1/2 quarts.  Serves 6.
