EGG NOG CANDY


1  c. egg nog
2  c. sugar
2  Tbsp. white corn syrup
1/4  tsp. salt
2  Tbsp. butter or margarine
1/2  c. quartered candied cherries
1/2  c. diced toasted almonds

      Combine egg nog, sugar, corn syrup and salt in a 2 1/2-quart saucepan.  Cook until syrup reaches 235 degrees; on candy thermometer or until it forms soft ball when dropped into cold water.  Stir frequently to prevent scorching.  Cool sugar mixture to lukewarm and add butter, beating constantly until candy begins to lose its gloss.  Stir in cherries and nuts and spread into buttered pie plate.  Do this quickly or candy will set in saucepan.  Cool and cut into squares.
