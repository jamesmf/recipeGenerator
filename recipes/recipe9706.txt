SMOTHERED STEAK


4  small cubed steaks
1  can beef broth
2  Tbsp. flour mixed with 2 oz. cold water
2  tsp. garlic
1  onion, sliced
  salt
  pepper

      Season steaks with salt, pepper and garlic and brown on both sides (5 to 10 minutes) in 1 teaspoon oil. In separate pan, heat beef broth and add flour and water mixture. Stir and let thicken. If you need it to be thickened more, add additional flour to mixture and stir with a fork. Be careful and add additional flour slowly or it will be lumpy. Add sliced onions and pepper to taste. Beef broth is salty so be careful about adding additional salt. Add gravy to steaks and let simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Makes 4 servings.
