STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE


2  c. sifted flour
3  tsp. baking powder
1/2  tsp. salt
2  Tbsp. sugar
1/2  c. shortening
1  egg, well beaten
1/3  c. milk (about)
1  pkg. frozen strawberries, slightly defrosted
  whipped cream

      Set oven for very hot (450 degrees;).  Grease 8-inch round cake pan. Mix and sift flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.  Cut in shortening with 2 knives or a pastry blender, until mixture looks like coarse meal.  Combine egg and milk; stir into flour mixture. If dough is too stiff, add more milk.  Pat or roll out into an 8-inch circle and put in pan.
      Bake 15 to 18 minutes or until brown.  Remove from pan and split the cake.  Put lower half on a serving plate and cover with half the berries.  Top with remaining cake and berries.  Serve with cream.  Makes 6 to 8 servings.
      Note:  In place of frozen berries, you may use 2 quarts fresh strawberries, sliced and sweetened.
