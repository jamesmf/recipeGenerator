HOOT OWLS


2 1/2  c. sifted flour
2  tsp. double-acting baking powder
1/2  tsp. salt
3/4  c. butter or margarine
1  c. firmly packed brown sugar
1  egg (unbeaten)
1  tsp. vanilla
1 1/2  sq. unsweetened chocolate
1/4  tsp. baking soda
  chocolate chips
  whole cashews

      Sift together flour, baking powder and salt.  Cream butter with brown sugar.  Add egg and vanilla; beat well.  Gradually blend in dry ingredients.  Combine melted, cooled chocolate with baking soda.  Remove 2/3 dough mixture to floured surface.  Blend chocolate mixture into remaining 1/3 dough mixture.  Chill for easier handling.  Roll out half of light dough to 10 x 4 1/2-inch strip.  Shape half of chocolate dough into 10 x 2-inch strip; place on strip of light dough.  Mold light dough around dark; wrap in foil.  Repeat with remaining dough.  Chill 2 hours.  Cut into slices 1/8 to 1/4-inch thick; place 2 slices together on greased baking sheet to resemble an owl.  Pinch top corner of each slice to form ears.  Place a chocolate chip in center of each slice for eyes.  Press a whole cashew nut between slices for a beak.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 8 to 12 minutes.  Remove from baking sheet immediately.
