1  c. chopped white onions
3  Tbsp. butter
4  c. chicken broth
1/2  c. rice, uncooked
3/4  lb. broccoli (1 1/2 bunches)
1  c. lite cream*

      Cook onions in 3 tablespoons butter until wilted, 5 to 10 minutes.  Add broth, rice and broccoli and cover.  Simmer over low heat until tender, 10 to 20 minutes.  Puree soup; add cream and reheat.  May serve with grated Parmesan cheese on top or chopped dill and butter.
      *Evaporated milk or heavy cream may be used for a richer soup. The heavier the cream, the less you will taste the broccoli.
