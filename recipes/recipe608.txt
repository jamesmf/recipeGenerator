GRILLED STEAK WITH MUSTARD MARINADE



4  lb. lean flank steak, well trimmed
1/4  c. grainy-style Dijon mustard
2  Tbsp. lime juice
1 1/2  Tbsp. reduced-sodium soy sauce
1  Tbsp. hoisin sauce
1  tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1  tsp. finely minced garlic
1  tsp. finely minced fresh ginger
  freshly ground pepper to taste

      Place the steak in a large glass or ceramic dish.  In a medium bowl, whisk the remaining ingredients together.  Pour over the meat; coat both sides.  Cover and allow to marinate at room temperature for 1 hour or in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill or a broiler.  Remove the steak from the marinade and grill for 5 minutes on each side or until cooked to the desired doneness, basting occasionally with the marinade. Serve immediately, sliced on the bias.  Serves 8.
