BROILED SCALLOPS


1 1/4  lb. sea scallops
4  oz. butter
  juice of 1 lemon
1  tsp. paprika
  salt and pepper
1  c. soft fresh bread crumbs
  lemon wedges

      If scallops are very large, halve them.  Place them into a colander or large strainer and rinse.  Do not let them soak.  Let scallops drain, then roll in towel to dry.  Melt the butter and mix in lemon juice, paprika and salt and pepper to taste.  Put butter mixture in a shallow bowl and bread crumbs in another.  Preheat broiler.  Dip scallops into the warm butter, then into the bread crumbs, until coated and arrange them in a single layer on a shallow flameproof dish.  Broil the scallops 5-inches from heat source for 2 minutes until brown.  Serve with lemon wedges for garnish.
