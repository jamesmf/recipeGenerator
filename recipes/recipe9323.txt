SPARERIBS AND CABBAGE


3  lb. spareribs
  water (to cover)
2  small cabbage heads OR savoy cabbage
2  tsp. salt (more later, if needed)
1  onion, diced
1  carrot, diced
8  celery roots, diced
1  parsley root, diced
  pepper (to taste)
1  Tbsp. butter
2  Tbsp. flour
1/2  bouillon cube (optional)

      Start meat in enough water to cover.  When water begins to simmer, remove scum.  Simmer uncovered for 1/2 hour.
      Cut cabbage into quarters and put in a Dutch oven.  Cover with water and add salt.  Parboil in this salt water about 20 minutes or until tender.
      Drain cabbage and add to meat.  Add onions, carrots, celery roots and parsley root.  Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.  Continue simmering in a tightly covered pan until meat is tender, about 1 hour.
      Discard vegetables (except cabbage).
      Melt butter.  Blend in flour.  Dilute with a little stock in which meat was cooked.  If stock has not cooked down enough and seems too thin, enrich with bouillon cube.  Pour over meat and cabbage.  Simmer another 1/2 hour.
      Makes 4 to 5 servings.
