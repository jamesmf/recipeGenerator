CREAM OF BROCCOLI SOUP
(Low-Fat)  

10  oz. pkg. frozen chopped broccoli, thawed
2  c. skim or 1/2 percent milk
1  Tbsp. margarine or oil
1  pkg. (2 oz.) or 1 to 1 1/2 c. potato flakes
2  tsp. dried onion flakes
10 1/2  oz. can chicken broth (or 1 1/4 c. water and 2 Tbsp. chicken flavored bouillon granules)
  black pepper to taste

      Cook broccoli until tender and set aside.  Combine milk and margarine in a medium saucepan until thoroughly heated, but do not boil.  Stir in potato and onion flakes.  Mash the broccoli well and blend it into milk potato mixture.  (For a smoother consistency, place the milk potato mixture in a blender, add the broccoli, and process for 30 seconds.  Scrape down the sides and process for another 30 seconds.  Return to the saucepan.)  Stir in the broth or bouillon, water and pepper.  Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent sticking.  Makes four 1 cup servings.
