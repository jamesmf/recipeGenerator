POTATO PANCAKES
(Rievkooche or Reibekuchen)  

2  large potatoes (about 2 1/2 c.), grated
3  c. water
1  tsp. lemon juice
  boiled potato, mashed
1  egg, beaten
2  Tbsp. milk
1/2  tsp. salt
9  Tbsp. vegetable oil

      Measure water into a large bowl and add lemon juice.  Grate raw potatoes into the bowl filled with water (the lemon juice should help prevent the potatoes from turning brown).
      Place potatoes into cheesecloth and drain off liquid.  Squeeze out as much liquid as possible from the potatoes.  Set aside.
      In a large bowl, beat the mashed potato with the egg, milk, and salt to form a batter.  Add the grated potatoes and mix well. Using 3 tablespoons of oil for each batch, drop batter for 3 pancakes at a time into hot oil in large frying pan.  When the pancakes are firm and golden brown on the bottom side, turn and brown the other side.  Remove; drain on paper towels and keep warm in a preheated oven.  Continue until all batter is used.  Serve immediately with applesauce.
