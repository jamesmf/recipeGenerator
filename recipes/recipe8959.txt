PEPPERED STEAK


  tenderized round steak
  small jar soy sauce
  carrots
  bell pepper
3  Tbsp. oil
  water

      Cut steak into strips. Heat oil. Add strips and cook until brown on high heat. Drain off oil. Pour small jar of soy sauce in with meat and cover meat completely with water. Cook at a slow simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, making sure water is always covering steak.
      Cut carrots and bell pepper into slices. Add after meat has simmered for 2 hours. After carrots and pepper have simmered with meat for about 30 minutes, check to see if meat, carrots and pepper are soft (should be cutable with fork). Serve over rice or eat as is!
