2  c. Orobianco or medium-dry white wine

      About 1 1/2 hours before serving, in 12-inch skillet over medium heat in oil, cook garlic until golden; remove and discard garlic. In drippings, over medium heat, brown chicken and sausages, a few at a time. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings. Return chicken and sausages to skillet. Stir in wine, mushrooms and salt; bring to boiling. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer 30 minutes or until chicken is fork-tender. Arrange chicken and sausages on warm platter.
