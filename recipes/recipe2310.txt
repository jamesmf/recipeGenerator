POTATOES ON THE GRILL


  Russet potatoes
  salt
  pepper
  butter
  seasoned salt (if desired)
  sliced onion (if desired)

      From a roll of heavy-duty aluminum foil, tear off approximately 24 to 36-inches.  Leaving the foil in one piece, place half on a flat surface, with the other half away from the working area. Spray the foil on the flat surface with the cooking spray.  Wash potatoes, removing defects, but do not peel.  Slice in 1/8-inch slices, horizontally.  Place sliced potatoes on the sprayed section of aluminum foil, keeping potatoes away from the edge.  Season with salt, pepper, butter, seasoned salt and onions, if desired.  Mix potatoes to spread the seasonings.  Fold the other half section of foil over the potatoes so it meets on the sides; fold on all 3 open sides to close securely.  Place on a hot grill for approximately 30 minutes.  Try not to peek, as the steam builds up inside and aids the cooking process.  "Package" may be turned once during grilling. To test for doneness, pierce through foil with a long-tine fork. My favorite parts of the "package" are the potatoes that are "extra-done" and stick to the foil.
