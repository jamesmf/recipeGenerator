CHOCOLATE COCONUT MACAROONS


2  sq. (1 oz. each) semi-sweet chocolate
1/2  c. sugar
1/2  c. shredded coconut
1/4  tsp. vanilla
2  Tbsp. heavy cream
2  egg whites
1/8  tsp. salt

      Melt the chocolate; stir in the sugar, coconut, vanilla and cream.  Let cool completely.  Beat the egg whites with salt until stiff.  Add the chocolate mixture; fold together gently but thoroughly with a metal spoon.  Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto cookie sheets lined with parchment, leaving room for spreading. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes at 350 degrees; or until firm to the touch.  Let cool on the cookie sheets.
