1  Duncan Hines cake mix (any flavor)
1  Duncan Hines frosting (vanilla)
1 (12 oz.)  pkg. M&M's
2  c. flaked coconut
  green food coloring
  colored Easter eggs or Easter candy

      Cake:  Fix according to directions on box in 2 (8 or 9-inch) round layers.  Cool completely.  Using 1 layer, cut a circle in the center of cake, leaving a ring measuring 1 1/2 inches from the edge to the center.  Remove the center.
      Frosting:  Place the uncut cake layer on plate.  Frost the top with Duncan Hines frosting.  Place the ring from the other layer on the frosted layer and the top of the cake.
      Grass:  Mix 2 drops of food coloring with 1/2 teaspoon of water in a medium bowl.  Add coconut and mix with a fork until the coconut is uniformly colored.
      Decorate, using M&M's.  Decorate the basket side and top. Place coconut grass in the center of the basket.  Fill the basket with colored eggs or candy.
      Handle:  Fold the aluminum foil (16 x 8-inches) half lengthwise and continue folding in half lengthwise 3 more times.  The final size is 16 x 1/2-inch.  Wrap with ribbon, securing ends with tape. Insert ends into cake, bending to form a handle with a bow.
