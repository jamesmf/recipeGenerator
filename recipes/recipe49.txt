CHOCOLATE APRICOT FONDANT


6  oz. dried apricots
1/3  c. apricot brandy
14  oz. semi-sweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
1/2  c. brewed Espresso coffee
1 1/4  c. plus 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter
6  egg yolks
8  egg whites
  whipped cream
  fresh or canned apricots (for decoration)

      In a small bowl, soak apricots in brandy for 1 hour.  Line an 11 x 4-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap.  Melt chocolate with Espresso coffee in top of a double boiler over low heat, stirring well.  Add butter, a bit at a time, stirring until melted.  Remove from heat.  In a large bowl, beat egg yolks until pale yellow and fluffy.  Fold in apricots and brandy.  Slowly pour chocolate mixture into egg and apricot mixture; gently fold to blend.  Cool for 30 minutes.  In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until firm, but not stiff.  Fold gently into chocolate mixture.  Pour into plastic-lined loaf pan and freeze for 6 hours.  Cut into 3/4-inch slices.  Top with whipped cream and apricots.
