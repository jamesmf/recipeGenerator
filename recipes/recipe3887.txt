1 large avocado, mashed with 1  tsp. lemon juice
4 (8 oz.)  cartons sour cream, mixed with 1/2 c. mayonnaise and 1/2 pkg. taco seasoning mix
1  c. chopped black olives
1  c. chopped green onions
1  c. chopped tomatoes
1  c. grated sharp Cheddar cheese, mixed with 1 c. grated Monterey Jack cheese (for top)
