VEAL SCALLOPINI WITH MARSALA


1 1/2  lb. veal scallops (each piece should be at least 3-inches by 3-inches)
1/2  c. flour
  Salt and pepper
2  Tbsp. butter
2  Tbsp. canola oil
3  green onions (white and light green parts), minced fine
1/2  lb. fresh mushrooms, sliced
1/2  c. beef bouillon
1/2  c. dry marsala wine

      Pound veal scallops lightly with a mallet if they are too thick.  Dredge each in a mixture of flour, salt and pepper.  Over medium heat melt butter and oil together.  Add veal and turn up heat slightly.  Sauté, turning frequently until veal is browned on all sides; remove veal to separate plate.  Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the pan drippings.  Add the finely minced green onions and sauté until translucent.  Add the sliced mushrooms and scrape bottom of pan to bring up any juices.  Put in veal scallops, wine and beef bouillon.  Bring mixture to a boil, then turn heat down to very low; cover and let simmer for approximately 12 minutes until sauce is thickened.
