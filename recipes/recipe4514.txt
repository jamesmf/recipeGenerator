SALSA


30  tomatoes
2  large onions
1  green pepper and 1 red pepper
2  cloves garlic, minced
3  Tbsp. salt
1/2  c. vinegar
1/4  c. sugar
2 (12 oz.)  cans tomato paste
5  jalapeno peppers (take seeds out)
8  to 10 roasted Anaheim chilies (take seeds out and peel skin off)

      Cut tomatoes, onions and peppers into what size you want for chunkiness. Mix all together and boil for 15 minutes. You then need to do a tomato bath (like canning tomatoes) and boil with lids for another 30 minutes. This makes 12 pints.
