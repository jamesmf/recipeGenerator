KARHAI CHICKEN


2  chicken breasts, cut into 2-inch pieces
3/4  cup water
2  Tbsp. slivered ginger
2 small  cloves garlic, sliced
1-1/2  tsp. salt
10  whole black peppercorns
5  whole cloves
4  whole cardamom pods
2  sticks cinnamon, broken
1/4  tsp. cumin seeds
1/4  cup vegetable oil
2  small tomatoes, chopped
2  green chillies, chopped
4  oz. tomato sauce
2  Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
1/4  cup cilantro, chopped

      Add water, ginger, garlic, salt, peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and cumin to chicken and boil until chicken pieces are tender and most of the water is dried up.
      Now add the oil, tomatoes, green chilies and tomato sauce. Braise well over medium heat until chicken is very fragrant and oil starts returning to the top.  Add lemon juice and chopped cilantro.  Lower heat and cover.  Cook for an additional 10 minutes.
