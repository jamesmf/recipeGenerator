TACO SALAD


  head of lettuce
3  or 4 tomatoes
1  can red kidney beans
2  c. (bag) shredded taco cheese
1  bag Doritos
1  bottle creamy Italian dressing
1  lb. hamburg (optional)

      In a large mixing bowl, first chop up head of lettuce and put in.  Next layer should be your chopped up tomatoes.  Then rinse and drain your can of kidney beans and add them in.  The shredded cheese should go in next.  Take the bag of Doritos and smash them up and put on top of salad.  Wait until it is ready to be served to pour the bottle of dressing over it.
      If wanting to add in the hamburg, brown it; let it cool and add in through the entire mix, not in a layer.
