SWEET CHEEKS BAR-B-QUE SAUCE


1  c. vegetable oil
1  c. granulated sugar or 1 c. brown sugar
1  c. white vinegar or 1 c. cider vinegar
2  Tbsp. yellow French's mustard
2  Tbsp. French's Worcestershire sauce
1/2  Tbsp. black pepper
1/2  Tbsp. red pepper
1/2  Tbsp. paprika

      In large capacity blender, add all ingredients and blend. This sauce will separate, just shake up the container and enjoy. Keeps very well under refrigeration.  Very good on pork.  If heated, the sauce will be darker and thinner, but the taste remains the same.  Also serves as an excellent marinade.
