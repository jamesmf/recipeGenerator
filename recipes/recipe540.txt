CITRUS PUNCH


1 (12 oz.)  can frozen fruit punch
1 small  can frozen orange juice (optional)
1 small  can frozen lemonade (optional)
1 (2 liter)  bottle 7-Up
  ice cream (optional)

      Mix frozen punch with 2 cans water; mix thoroughly.  If you want to add any optional juices, mix them in now with 2 cans water. Then add 7-Up slowly so not to ruin bubbles.  Add ice and serve. If you want to add ice cream, omit ice and float your favorite ice cream on top.
