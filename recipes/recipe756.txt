HOMEMADE PASTA


2 1/4 to 2 1/2  c. flour
2  eggs
1  egg yolk
1  Tbsp. olive oil
1  tsp. salt

      In large bowl combine 1 cup flour, 1/3 cup water and remaining ingredients.  Use mixer on low speed.  Beat 2 minutes, occasionally scraping bowl with rubber spatula.  With wooden spoon, stir in enough additional flour to make soft dough.  Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and not sticky, approximately 20 times.  Roll and cut.
