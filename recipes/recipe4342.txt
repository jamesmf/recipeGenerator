ORIENTAL SALAD


4 - 6  slices of bacon, fried and crumbled
1/2  c. chow mein noodles
4  Tbsp. sesame seeds
1/3  c. sliced almonds
1  head lettuce
1  small onion (purple onion adds color)

      Brown and crumble bacon, drain on paper towel.  Toast sesame seeds and almonds at 350 degrees; for 5 minutes (watch closely, almonds burn easily).  Break lettuce into bite size pieces, add onions. Top with bacon, seeds, almonds and noodles.
Dressing:
1/2  c. salad oil
2  Tbsp. vinegar
1/4  c. white sugar
1  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper

      Add dressing and toss just before serving so that the noodles stay crunchy.
