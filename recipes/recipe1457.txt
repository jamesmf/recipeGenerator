SEAFOOD KEBABS


2  (6 oz.) pieces center-cut salmon fillet (about 2 3/4 lb.), skinned
12  medium shrimp (about 1/2 lb.), shelled, leaving the last joint and the tail intact
12  sea scallops (about 3/4 lb.), rinsed and patted dry
1/2  c. firmly packed dark brown sugar
1/2  c. fresh lemon juice
  dill sprigs for garnish
  lemon wedges (if desired)

      In a shallow dish, let six 12-inch wooden skewers soak in water to cover for 2 hours and let them drain on paper towel.  Cut each salmon fillet crosswise into six 1-inch thick slices.  Discard any small bones and beginning with the thicker end of each slice, roll the slice into a coil.  Thread one of the shrimp and one scallop onto a skewer, add 2 salmon coils and add another scallop and shrimp.  Make 5 more kebabs with remaining shrimp, scallops and salmon coils in same manner.  Can be prepared and chilled for several hours.  In a small bowl, stir brown sugar and lemon juice. Salt and pepper the kebabs; brush with brown sugar mixture and grill over glowing coals, basting often for 4 to 5 minutes on each side until salmon just flakes and shrimp are pink and firm.  Brush with remaining brown sugar mix.  Garnish with lemon wedges and dill sprigs.
