COQ AU VIN


1/2  lb. salt pork, diced
3  lb. fryer, cut up
1/2  lb. small mushrooms
1/2  lb. small white onions
1/4  c. minced shallots
1  garlic clove, minced
1  c. dry red wine
3/4  c. water
1/2  tsp. thyme leaves
1/8  tsp. pepper
1  bay leaf
4  parsley sprigs
2  Tbsp. butter, softened
2  Tbsp. flour

      In Dutch oven over medium heat, cook salt pork until golden and crisp, stirring often.  With slotted spoon, remove pork to paper towels to drain.  In drippings, cook chicken until browned, about 20 minutes.  Remove to medium bowl.  Spoon off all but about 1/4 cup fat; add mushrooms, onions, shallots, and garlic.  Cook until just wilted, about 5 minutes.  Stir in wine, water, thyme, pepper, bay leaf, and parsley.  Place chicken and salt pork over vegetables.  Over high heat, heat to boiling.  Reduce heat to low; cover; simmer 20 minutes or until chicken is fork-tender.  In cup, blend butter and flour.  Remove chicken and vegetables to platter; discard bay leaf and parsley.  Blend flour mixture into pan juices. Heat to boiling, stirring.  Spoon over chicken.
