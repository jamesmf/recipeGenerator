BURRITO PIE


1/4  c. salad oil
1/2  lb. ground beef
1  medium onion, diced
1 (4 oz.)  can chopped mild green chilies, drained
1/2  lb. Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
4  (8-inch) flour tortillas
1  clove garlic, minced
1 (8 oz.)  can refried beans
1/3  c. hot taco sauce

      In a 10-inch skillet over medium heat in hot salad oil, fry 1 tortilla at a time about 30 seconds on each side until lightly browned and blistered. With tongs, remove tortillas to paper towels to drain. Discard any remaining oil.
       Preheat oven to 350 degrees;. In the same skillet over high heat, cook ground meat, onion and garlic until all pan juices evaporate and meat is well browned, stirring occasionally. Remove skillet from heat; stir in green chilies, refried beans and taco sauce.
       In 10-inch pie plate, place 1 tortilla; top with 1/4 of bean mixture and 1/4 of cheese. Continue layering remaining tortillas with bean mixture and cheese. Bake pie 30 minutes or until heated through.
      You may sprinkle with 1 cup thinly sliced lettuce, a medium tomato and sliced ripe olives. I prefer to serve it with a salad. Makes 6 main dish servings.
