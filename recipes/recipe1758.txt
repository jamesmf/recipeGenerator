LOEMPIAS
(Indonesian Egg Rolls)  

1  medium onion, chopped
1  leek, sliced
1/2  lb. boneless chicken, cubed
1  Tbsp. soy sauce
1/2  lb. bean sprouts
1/2  tsp. garlic powder
1/4  lb. ham, finely chopped
1/3  lb. flour
1 1/4  c. water
1  egg white

      Fry chicken, onion and leek.  Add soy sauce, bean sprouts and garlic powder (add a little more oil if necessary).  Fry until bean sprouts are getting translucent, but not limp.  Add ham and let cool.  Make a smooth batter with flour, water and egg white.  Heat a generous amount of oil or butter in an omelet pan, over a low fire.  Place 1/2 of batter in pan, a little at a time, to make 6 crepes.  Only fry one side of the crepes.  Put 1/2 of the filling on fried side of crepes and fold crepes like envelopes, gluing with a mixture of water and flour.  Fry the loempias in generous hot oil in wok or big frying pan until they are brown on both sides. Serves 6. Delicious with sweet and sour sauce or peanut butter sauce.
