HAM AND CHEESE QUICHE


2  pastry shells (9 inches)
2  cups diced fully cooked ham
2  cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
2  tsp. dried minced onion
4  eggs
2  cups half-and-half cream
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper

      Line unpricked pastry shells with a double thickness of heavy-duty foil.  Bake at 400 degrees for 5 minutes.  Remove foil; bake 5 minutes longer.
      Divide ham, cheese and onion between the shells.  In a bowl, whisk eggs, cream, salt and pepper.  Pour into the shells.  You may cover and freeze up to three months. Or, cover edges with foil and bake at 400 degrees for 35-40 minutes or until knife inserted near the center comes out clean.  Let stand for 5-10 minutes before cutting. Each quiche serves 6.
