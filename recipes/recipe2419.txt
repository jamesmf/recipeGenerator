MOM'S OLD FASHIONED MOLASSES STACK CAKE


1  lb. butter or margarine
6  eggs
2 1/2  c. sugar (Mommy sometimes used about half brown)
3  tsp. lemon extract
4  c. sifted flour
1 1/2  tsp. baking powder
1  tsp. salt
1/2 to 3/4  c. molasses
  about 1 c. thick apple butter

      Cream butter and sugar; add eggs and beat well.  Add lemon extract and blend.  Sift dry ingredients together and add to creamed mixture.  Add molasses, blending well.  (Mommy never used nuts or candied fruit in her cakes, but these can be added if desired, also raisins.)  Bake in 4 or 5 small round cake pans at 325 degrees; for about 1 1/2 hours or until a clean broom straw inserted into the middle of cake comes out clean.
      When cake layers are cooled, use the apple butter to spread between the layers as you stack them.  (Mommy usually had at least 5 to 7 layers.)  Use caramel or other icing on top and sides. (Mommy always used her homemade caramel icing on top and sort of let it run down the sides without spreading it much and her cakes would literally just melt in your mouth!)
