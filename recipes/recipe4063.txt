ARTICHOKE BALLS


2  c. marinated artichoke hearts
1/2  c. romano cheese, grated
1  Tbsp. granulated garlic
1  tsp. salt
4  eggs
1/4  c. olive oil
2 to 3  c. Italian bread crumbs

      Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Place all ingredients, except bread crumbs, into a food processor.  Process until totally blended.  Add bread crumbs until mixture gets too thick to process.  Remove from processor and mix in more bread crumbs until mixture becomes thick enough to form a ball.  Place formed balls on a cookie sheet and bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned.  Serve hot or cold.
