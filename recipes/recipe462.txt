CALZONES


1  lb. ground beef
1/2  c. chopped onion
16  oz. pizza sauce
4  Tbsp. chopped black olives
2  tsp. dried crushed basil
1  tsp. dried crushed oregano
6  French rolls (about 8-inches long)
12  oz. shredded Mozzarella cheese

      Cook meat and onion until brown; drain fat.  Remove from heat. Stir in the sauce, olives, basil and oregano.  Cut a thin slice from top of each roll.  Hollow out bottom of roll to within 1/2-inch of edges.  Sprinkle about 3 tablespoons cheese into each roll bottom.  Spoon meat mixture over each.  Sprinkle with remaining cheese.  Replace roll tops.  Wrap individually in foil and refrigerate or freeze.
      To serve:  Place wrapped sandwiches on baking sheet.  If refrigerated, bake at 375 degrees; about 40 minutes.  If frozen, bake about an hour.  Great served with a fresh fruit plate alongside!
