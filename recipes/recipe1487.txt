SPICY GRILLED CORN


1/3  c. butter or margarine
2  Tbsp. prepared mustard (Dijon style)
1  Tbsp. prepared horseradish (white)
1  tsp. Worcestershire sauce (white)
1/4  tsp. lemon pepper
6  ears fresh corn (husks and silks removed)

      In a saucepan, melt butter.  Stir in mustard, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce and lemon pepper.  Place each ear of corn on a 12 x 9-inch piece of heavy-duty foil.  Drizzle butter mixture over corn.  Fold edges of foil to seal pouch securely, leaving space for steam expansion.  Grill over medium hot coals, turning occasionally for 15 minutes.  Serves 6.
