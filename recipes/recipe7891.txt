INDONESIAN BEEF SATAY WITH SPICY PEANUT SAUCE

Beef Satay:
2  lb. beef, thinly sliced
3  Tbsp. curry powder
1/2  tsp. Sambal Bajak (combination chili relish paste)*
2  cloves garlic, minced
2  large onion, minced
1/2   tsp. salt
4  Tbsp. lemon juice
1  Tbsp. honey
1/2  tsp. ginger paste

 
Spicy Peanut Sauce:
1  cup peanut butter (crunchy or smooth)
1/2  cup coconut milk
1  Tbsp. lemon juice
1/4  cup soy sauce
1  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
2  dashes hot sauce
1/4  tsp. salt
  Crushed red pepper flakes

      Slice the meat into thin strips, no more than 1/4-inch thick and about 1-inch wide. Make strips paper-thin if possible. Mix curry powder, chili relish, garlic, onions, salt, lemon juice, honey and ginger paste in a large bowl. Add the meat strips and toss well to coat with the marinade. Thread meat strips onto skewers, 3 or 4 pieces per skewer. Make sure that plenty of onion and garlic bits cling to the meat. Arrange skewers of meat in a dish, cover with any remaining marinade, and refrigerate until ready to grill. Strain and reserve the marinade.  Brown or grill the meat skewers over hot coals or in broiler.
      To prepare the sauce, gently heat peanut butter in saucepan and slowly stir in the reserved marinade along with the remaining ingredients.  Mix well with wire whisk until smooth and even.
      Serve with plain or fried rice.  Place grilled meat skewers on a bed of rice and top with peanut butter sauce.  Adjust salt and chili according to preference.
      *Sambal Bajak is available at almost any Oriental food mart.
