DIJON CHICKEN ELITE


8  chicken breast halves
3  c. bread crumbs
1  c. Parmesan cheese
1/4  c. chopped fresh parsley
1  c. melted butter
2 large  cloves garlic, minced
2  tsp. Worcestershire sauce
2  Tbsp. Dijon mustard
1/8  tsp. white pepper

      Wash and dry chicken parts.  Place crumbs in large bowl.  Add cheese and parsley and combine well.  Melt butter.  Add garlic after melting and simmer a few minutes to absorb flavor.  Remove from heat.  Add Worcestershire sauce, mustard and white pepper. Mix well.  When cool enough to handle, dip chicken pieces in butter mixture, then roll in bread crumb mixture.  Place in single layer on cookie sheet.  Pour any remaining butter mixture over chicken. Bake in 350 degrees; oven for 25 to 30 minutes.  Do not overbake.
