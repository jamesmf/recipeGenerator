CRAB CAKES


1  lb. crab meat (jumbo, lump or backfin)*
2 heaping  Tbsp. mayonnaise
2  eggs, lightly beaten
1/2  tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper
1/4  tsp. salt
1/2  small onion, grated
1/2  Tbsp. mustard powder
18  Ritz crackers, crumbled

      *(The jumbo is best for large patties, but not good for tiny ones.  The backfin is good for both.)
      Combine all ingredients except the crackers.  Add cracker crumbs in as close to sauting as possible so that they don't get too moist from the other ingredients.  Form into patties the size of hamburger patties or hors d'oeuvre-size, depending on how they will be served.  Saut in frying pan on a medium-to-high heat in butter, 10 minutes a side.  Make sure the crab cake is crispy outside but moist and juicy inside.
      The recipe makes enough for about six hamburger-sized cakes or 15 to 18 hors d'oeuvres.
      A simple tartar sauce to accompany the crab cakes:  mayonnaise, grated onion, lemon juice (eye the proportions).
