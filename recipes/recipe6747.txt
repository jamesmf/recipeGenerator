Repeat layers starting with the noodles.  Top with remaining 4 slices of Mozzarella cheese.  Pour water around the sides of the pan.  Cover tightly with foil.  Bake in preheated 350 degrees; oven 1 hour.  Uncover; bake 20 minutes more or until bubbly.  Let stand 15 to 20 minutes.  Garnish as directed.  Makes 8 to 10 servings.
