CHOCOLATE POPSICLES


3  c. milk
2  Tbsp. sugar
1  pkg. instant chocolate pudding

      You will need eight 3 or 4 ounce paper cups and 8 popsicle sticks.
      Pour milk in large bowl.  Add sugar and pudding mix.  Beat 3 minutes on low with mixer or 5 minutes by hand.  Pour into cups. When partially frozen, place sticks in center.  Freeze until solid. Popsicle molds or ice cube trays may be used instead of paper cups.
