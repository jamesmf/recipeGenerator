CORN TIMBALES


2  slightly beaten eggs
1  c. skim milk
1/4  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. pepper
1 (12 oz.)  can whole kernel corn, drained (can use 1/2 c. of another cooked or canned vegetable)
1/4  c. sliced green onions
2  Tbsp. fine dry bread crumbs
2  Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese
2  tsp. margarine, melted

      In a medium mixing bowl, stir together eggs, milk, salt and pepper.  Stir in corn and green onions (may set aside some corn and green onions for garnish).  Spray 2 (12-ounce) casseroles with nonstick coating.  Divide egg mixture between the two.  Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees; for 25 minutes.
      Stir together bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and margarine.  Put on top of baked casseroles.  Put back in oven for 15 minutes more or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.  Garnish with reserved corn and onions.  Makes 2 servings.
