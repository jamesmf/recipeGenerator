6  medium potatoes
6  medium pork chops
2  Tbsp. oil

1/2  c. milk
15  oz. (1 can) green beans

      Peel and dice potatoes.  Set aside.
      Brown pork chops in hot oil.  Remove chops and add soup to drippings to make gravy (if gravy is too thick, add milk to thin). Cover bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish with potatoes.  Add green beans.  Place chops on top of beans and cover with gravy.
      Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 325 degrees; for 1 1/2 hours.
