WHITE BEANS


1  lb. white beans (camellia) or new crop (fresh)
1  medium onion, chopped fine
2  or 3 onion tops, chopped fine
3  Tbsp. cooking oil
  parsley flakes
  salt and pepper to taste

	Sort and wash white beans. After they are clean, fill pot with water and boil beans until they start to split open (about 1 hour). While this is cooking, fry onions and onion tops down until they are clear (on medium heat). Once beans are split, drain and fill pot again with more water. Put beans back to boil and cook on high heat. Add onion  mixture to pot. Sprinkle parsley flakes. Let cook until thick, but remember to smash beans on side of pot for creamy ones and to lower the heat as they become thick. Watch not to scorch the bottom (that's why you lower the heat as you go).
