CHICKEN PIE


1/2  c. margarine
5 1/2  Tbsp. flour
3  c. chicken broth
1  c. milk
  desired seasonings
1/4  tsp. pepper
3  c. or more cooked chicken (leave in large pieces or diced, as desired)
1/2  tsp. salt
  crust

      Make a roux of margarine and flour; when bubbling, add chicken broth and milk.  Stir with a wire whisk to blend.  Cook over medium heat until thickened and smooth.  Taste and adjust seasonings.  You may want to add celery salt and onion powder to taste.  Mixture will thicken a little as the crust bakes.  You will want the mixture to be about as thick as cream of chicken soup, half diluted.  If you need more broth, add cream of chicken, mushroom or celery soup and dilute to desired thickness and mix with the thickened broth.  Well drained peas or canned mixed vegetables may be added to broth.  Place chicken in a baking dish; pour thickened broth over chicken.
      Crust may be made by using pastry recipe and rolling out to fit the top of baking dish or cut in strips for lattice crust. You can also use canned biscuits dipped in melted margarine and placed on top of filling.  I use my regular biscuit recipe, roll them a little thinner than normal and cut a hole in the center. Make enough for each person to have at least one biscuit.  Dip biscuit in melted margarine and place on the hot chicken mixture. Bake at 350 degrees; for 30 minutes or until golden brown.  (Lift up an edge of the crust to be sure it has baked done on the side next to the filling.)
