SALMON CROQUETTES


1  can pink salmon
2  beaten eggs
8  single white crackers, crushed
1 1/4  c. mashed potatoes
  salt and pepper to taste

      Drain the salmon.  Remove bones and skin.  Flake the salmon in a large mixing bowl.  Add the remaining four ingredients to the flaked salmon and mix well.  Use your hands or an ice cream dipper to form individual croquettes.  Place a few at a time in skillet of deep hot oil (not smoking).  Cook until golden brown.  Turn only once (approximately 7) or place all of the mixture in a greased Pyrex dish.  Bake at 375 degrees; until golden brown on top.
