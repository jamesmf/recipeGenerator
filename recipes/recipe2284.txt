MEDITERRANEAN MELANGE FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE


1 1/2  c. elbow macaroni
1  can sliced mushrooms
1 large  jar your favorite prepared spaghetti sauce
1  loaf garlic bread
1  lb. ground beef
1  can pitted black olives
1/4  lb. cubed mild Cheddar cheese

      Cook the macaroni and drain.  Brown the ground beef and drain. Combine the macaroni, the cooked ground beef, mushroom pieces, sliced black olives and enough spaghetti sauce to make a Sloppy Joes consistency.  Heat to simmering.  Add the cubed cheese and continue heating only until the cheese starts to melt.  Remove from heat and serve with garlic bread.
