MAPLE-MUSTARD GLAZED CHICKEN


1/2  c. maple syrup
1/3  c. apple cider vinegar
1/4  c. water
3  Tbsp. Dijon mustard
1/2  tsp. salt
1  Tbsp. vegetable oil
2  lb. skinless boneless chicken breasts

      In a small saucepan, combine the maple syrup, vinegar, water, mustard and salt. Bring to a boil; immediately reduce to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in the oil. Cool to room temperature. Cut the chicken into pieces weighing about 4 ounces each. Place in a shallow dish or sealable plastic bag and coat with enough sauce to cover. Let the chicken marinate for 30 minutes to 2 hours (in the refrigerator). Turn several times. Preheat and prepare the grill. Grill chicken for 4 minutes, then brush with the marinade; turn and continue to cook until done, about 5 to 8 minutes longer.
      This recipe can also be broiled. Cover a baking sheet with foil and cook the chicken on it, about 6-inches from the heat source, basting and turning once. Serves 8.
