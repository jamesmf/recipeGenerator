FUMI SALAD


1  head cabbage, chopped in bite size pieces
2  pkg. Ramen noodles (beef flavor)
1/4 to 1/3  c. sesame seeds, toasted
1/4 to 1/3  c. sliced almonds, toasted

	Chop cabbage and place in a very large bowl. Toast sesame seeds and almonds (being careful since they can burn easily). Remove the seasoning from the noodles and set aside for the dressing. Crunch up the noodles into small pieces. Mix all ingredients together. Prepare dressing.
Dressing:
1/4 to 1/3  c. sugar (more may be needed to taste)
1/3  c. rice vinegar
1/8 to 1/4  c. sesame oil (optional)
1/4  c. olive oil
  seasoning from Ramen noodles

	In a small bowl, mix all ingredients until well blended. In some cases, the sugar does not dissolve thoroughly, but that is okay. Pour over cabbage and mix well. Refrigerate before serving.
