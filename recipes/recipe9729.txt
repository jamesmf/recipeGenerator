KALUA PIG
(Hawaiian-Style Luau Pork)  

1  (6 lb.) pork roast
1 1/2  Tbsp. coarse salt or Hawaiian sea salt
1  Tbsp. liquid smoke flavoring

      Pierce pork all over with a carving fork. Rub salt, then liquid smoke over meat. Place roast in a crock-pot slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 16 to 20 hours, turning once during cooking time. Remove meat from slow cooker and shred, adding drippings as needed to moisten.
      To make this more "traditional" for my Hawaii-raised kids, I added a small head of cabbage, thinly sliced, right on top of the pork roast during the last 5 hours of cooking time. We serve this with steamed Calrose rice.
