(New Smaller Version)  

4 to 5  lb. beef roast
1 to 1 1/2  lb. oxtail
5 to 6  lb. chicken (combination of whole chicken and pkg. of chicken thighs or legs)
2  heads of cabbage
8  to 10 onions
1  green pepper
5  lb. carrots
2  rutabaga
10  lb. potatoes
2  bunches of celery
3  oz. Worcestershire
4  quarts home-canned tomatoes
4  cans (15 oz.) tomato sauce
4  cans green beans, with liquid
4  cans peas, with liquid
4  cans whole kernel corn, with liquid
1/8  lb. salt, more to taste
1 1/2  Tbsp. garlic
2  oz. parsley
1  box of bay leaves
1/8  lb. pepper, more to taste

      First Day:  Early morning, put beef and oxtail in a large crock pot covered with water.  Put chicken in a second large crock pot covered with water.  Cook all day, covered.  In the evening, remove beef and all bones from broth to bowl.  Allow to cool until it can be handled.  Pull all meat off bones and return meat to broth.  Do the same with chicken, remove from broth, debone and return meat to broth.  Put both in refrigerator overnight.
      Second Day:  Use two 20 quart kettles.  Early morning, pour both `beef in broth' and `chicken in broth' into one kettle.  Mix well, then divide equally in both kettles.  Start cooking.  Chop all vegetables and divide equally between the 2 kettles.  Also put equal amounts in each kettle of all spices, canned vegetables, etc. If too much for 2 kettles, use additional smaller kettle or crock pot until it cooks down enough to fit in the large kettles.  Add water as needed.  Cook all day.
