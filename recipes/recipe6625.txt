MEAT LOAF


1  lb. ground meat

1  small onion
  Salt & pepper to taste
  Enough milk to moisten

      Mix all ingredients together and make into a loaf.  Bake at 325 degrees; for 30 - 45 minutes.  This can be made the night before and set overnight in the refrigerator and baked the next day.  This mixture can also be used to stuff green peppers.  Makes enough for 2.
