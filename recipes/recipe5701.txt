	Cut open all of the peppers and remove seeds.  Roll the same peppers together in foil. Grill them for 15 minutes. Unwrap the foil from around the peppers and drain off any water. Put all the peppers in a blender and blend until liquefied. Put liquid in a pot and add half a cup of water. Bring to a boil and add salt to your taste. Very hot sauce.
