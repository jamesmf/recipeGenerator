STUFFED BACON ROLLS


12  slices bacon
1  medium onion, chopped
2  cloves garlic, minced
1  egg
1/2  c. tomato sauce
3/4  c. soft breadcrumbs
1 (4 oz.)  can sliced mushrooms, drained
2  Tbsp. snipped parsley
1  lb. ground beef
1/4  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. pepper

      Partially cook bacon.  Drain; reserve 2 tablespoons drippings. Set bacon aside.  Cook onion and garlic in drippings until tender, but not browned.  In bowl, combine egg and tomato sauce; stir in breadcrumbs, mushrooms and onion.  Mix parsley, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.  Add meat; mix well.  Divide into 4 parts. Place 2 strips bacon side by side on waxed paper.  Cut slice in half crosswise.  Place 2 1/2 slices at one end of bacon slices, overlapping slightly.  Pat 1/4 of meat mixture evenly over bacon; roll up jellyroll style, starting at narrow end.  Place rolls, seam side down, on rack in 12 x 7 x 2-inch baking dish.  Repeat with remaining bacon and meat.  Bake in oven about 40 minutes for medium doneness.
