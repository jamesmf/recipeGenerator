1 1/2  lb. ground cured ham
1/2  lb. ground fresh pork
2  eggs
1/2  c. milk
1/2  tsp. pepper
  cracker crumbs (to make stiff enough to form into a loaf)
1/2  c. brown sugar
1/4  c. vinegar

2  tsp. mustard
1  lb. boneless skinless chicken breasts (four 4 oz. pieces)

1/2  c. seasoned bread crumbs (Italian-style)
4  servings olive oil cooking spray or enough to coat chicken

      Preheat oven to 400 degrees;. Coat a baking sheet with olive oil cooking spray. Place chicken breasts between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and pound to 1/4-inch thickness. Arrange 1 slice of ham and 1 slice of cheese on each chicken breast. Starting from shorter end of chicken, roll up breast into a tight pinwheel. Tuck in ends. Secure with toothpicks. Place flour, honey, mustard and bread crumbs in 3 separate shallow bowls. Add chicken to flour; turn to coat. Transfer chicken to honey mustard; turn to coat. Place chicken in bread crumbs; turn to coat. Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet and coat with cooking spray. Bake until chicken is golden brown and cooked through, about 40 minutes.
