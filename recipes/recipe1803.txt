1  tsp. salt

1 (8 oz.)  can tomato sauce

      Mix flour, salt and pepper together.  Pound this mixture into the Swiss steak on both sides.  Fry the steak in a skillet with about 1/2-inch oil in it until crisp or shorter time if in a hurry on both sides.  Place steak in bottom of ovenproof pan.  On each piece of steak, place a slice of onion and about 1 tablespoon ketchup.  Pour tomato sauce in plastic bowl and add 8 ounces more of water.  Stir and pour down the side of your steak pan.  You may add green pepper between the steak layers.  Bake at least 1 hour at 350 degrees;.  The longer you bake it, the more tender it becomes.
