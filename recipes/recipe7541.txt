BUSH BUNS


1  lb. ground beef
1  c. chopped onion
1/2  c. catsup
1  Tbsp. vinegar
1  tsp. celery seed
1  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
1  Tbsp. prepared mustard
1  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. pepper
1  tsp. MSG
1  pkg. hot roll mix (Pillsbury)
  Crisco (for deep frying)

      Brown beef and onion together.  Add remaining ingredients, except hot roll mix and Crisco.  Bring to a boil.  Simmer about 20 to 30 minutes.  Mix roll mix according to package directions. Divide dough into 24 equal parts (small balls).  Flatten each dough ball and place 1 spoonful of mixture in center.  Form dough around meat mixture, sealing seams so juice stays inside.  Allow dough to rise again.  Deep-fry in hot Crisco at 360 degrees; for about 5 minutes or until golden brown.  Drain on absorbent paper.  Best when eaten immediately, but also good to warm up leftovers in microwave.
