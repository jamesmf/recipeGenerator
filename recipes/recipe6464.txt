FRIED CHICKEN


2  well beaten eggs
6  cloves garlic
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper
1/2  tsp. baking powder
2  Tbsp. olive oil
1  fryer, disjointed

      Chop garlic fairly fine.  In a small dish, mix the garlic with a sprinkle of salt and puree it.  It will mash better when mixed with salt.  Make a mixture of the eggs, baking powder, garlic, olive oil and cayenne pepper.  Salt and pepper the chicken pieces and stir into the egg mixture.  Allow the chicken to marinate a few hours, turning occasionally.  After chicken has marinated, remove from the egg mixture and roll each piece in flour that has been seasoned with salt and pepper.  Heat the shortening or peanut oil in a skillet and when very hot, fry chicken over low heat until good and brown.  With a well tossed salad, a wonderful chicken that will delight your appetite.
