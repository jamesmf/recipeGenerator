SPANISH BEANS


1  lb. ground chuck
1  medium onion, chopped
1  stalk celery, chopped
1/2  bell pepper
1  can tomatoes
2  Tbsp. flour
1  can red kidney beans, drained

      Brown about a pound of ground chuck in small amount of oil. When meat is browned, add onion.  Let this cook for several minutes.  Next, add celery and bell pepper, then a can of tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Let these ingredients cook slowly for about 5 minutes.  At this point, if mixture is too juicy, it may be thickened by adding about a tablespoon of flour to make a smooth paste.  Add red kidney beans.  Simmer for 30 minutes.
