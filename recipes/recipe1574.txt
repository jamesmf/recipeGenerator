SLICED PANCAKE SOUP
(Frittatensuppe)  

1/2  pt. milk
4  oz. flour
1  egg
  pinch of salt
1  oz. cooking fat

      Make a smooth paste of the cold milk and flour.  Stir in the egg and salt.  Heat enough fat in an omelette pan to cover the bottom of the pan; spoon into the pan enough batter to cover the bottom thinly and evenly.  Fry until crisp on both sides.  Add more fat before frying each pancake.  When cold, the pancakes are rolled up individually and cut into thin strips.  Add to hot beef broth.
