BUTTERMILK YEAST BUNS


1  cake yeast
8  c. all-purpose or bread flour
3  c. buttermilk
1/2  c. butter, melted
1  tsp. baking soda
1/4  c. warm water
1/2  c. sugar
2  eggs, beaten
1  tsp. salt

      Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Stir to dissolve.  Add buttermilk and sugar.  Let mixture stand 15 minutes.  Add butter and eggs; mix.  Sift soda and salt with 4 cups flour and add to liquid mixture.  Beat until smooth batter forms.  Add remaining sifted flour, stirring with spoon until thick enough to handle with hands.  Knead on floured board.  Place in large greased mixing bowl.  Turn.  Cover; let rise until double, about 1 hour.  Punch dough down; form into buns.  (Squeeze dough into balls the size of an egg.)  Place on greased baking sheet; flatten slightly with hand.  Let rise until double, about 30 minutes.  Bake at 400 degrees; for 15 to 20 minutes.  Makes about 48 buns.
