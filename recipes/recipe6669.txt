ZUCCHINI QUICHE


3  c. thinly sliced zucchini
1  small onion, chopped
1  c. biscuit mix
1/2  c. grated cheese
4  eggs
1/2  c. vegetable oil
1/2  tsp. dried parsley
1/2  tsp. dried marjoram
1/4  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper

      Grease a 9 inch pie plate or a 10 x 6 inch baking dish.  Mix all ingredients together.  Pour into prepared pan and bake at 350 degrees; for 45 minutes or until golden brown.  (I sometimes add sausage I have browned and drained or ham I have cut into small pieces.)
