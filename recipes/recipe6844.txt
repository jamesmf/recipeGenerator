SWEET AND SOUR BEEF


1/2 to 1  lb. beef stew meat or hamburger
  salt and pepper to taste
  soy sauce
1  bag frozen Chinese veggies
3 to 4 heaping  Tbsp. apricot jelly
1 to 2  Tbsp. cornstarch (in cold water)

      In 10-inch skillet, brown meat, adding salt, pepper and soy sauce to taste. Drain excess grease. Add frozen veggies and as much water as the veggie bag recommends. Simmer with lid on. When veggies are nearly done, add jelly and cornstarch mixed in cold water. Stir regularly until sauce starts to gel. Serve over noodles or rice.
      Note: This recipe works equally well with cubed chicken. Also, apricot preserves can be used for richer flavor, but any large chunks of apricot will need to be diced.
