OVEN POT ROAST


  3-lb. beef roast
2  Tbsp. vegetable oil
1  large onion, sliced
4  medium carrots, cut in 1-inch pieces
1  can (28-oz.) stewed tomatoes
2  c. red wine
2  c. beef broth
2  Tbsp. dried parsley
6  cloves garlic, minced
2  bay leaves
2  tsp. dried thyme
1/2  tsp. pepper
6  medium potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters

      Preheat oven to 375 degrees;.  Heat oil in a large skillet and brown meat on all sides.  Transfer meat to a large Dutch oven or roaster.  Add all the remaining ingredients, except the potatoes, to the roaster.  The liquid should cover the vegetables and meat. Add more broth or water if necessary.  Cover and bake for 2 hours. Turn the beef after 1 hour.  Add the potatoes to the pan, increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees; and bake uncovered for about 1 hour longer, until meat and potatoes are tender.  Turn meat every 15 minutes.  Makes about 6 servings.
