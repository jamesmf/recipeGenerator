CORN CHOWDER


1/4  c. butter
6  Tbsp. chopped onion
3/4  c. chopped celery
2 1/2  c. hot water
2  medium boiling potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch cubes
3  c. fresh or frozen corn kernels, thawed
2  Tbsp. sugar (or less, according to taste)
2  Tbsp. flour
1  qt. half and half

      Melt butter in saucepan.  Add onion and celery; saut√© 5 minutes until soft, but not brown.  Add water, potatoes, corn, sugar, salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer until potatoes are barely tender, about 30 minutes.  Whisk flour into 1 cup half and half; stir into soup.  Add remaining half and half and simmer until soup has thickened to a creamy consistency, about 15 minutes.  Season to taste with additional salt and pepper if needed.  If too thick, add more milk; if too thin, simmer 5 to 10 minutes longer.  Makes 9 servings, about 1 cup each.
