CHICKEN TORTILLA CASSEROLE


6  boneless skinless chicken breast halves, cut into thin strips
1/2  c. sliced green onions
1  clove garlic, minced
3  Tbsp. cornstarch
4  c. cold chicken broth, defatted
1 1/2  c. shredded fat-free Monterey Jack cheese
1/2  c. fat-free salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip)
1/2  c. fat-free sour cream
1 (4 oz.)  can chopped green chiles (undrained)
1/2  c. ripe olives
1/4  c. chopped parsley
12  (7-inch) flour tortillas

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;. Heat a nonstick skillet and spray with vegetable oil cooking spray. Add the chicken, onions and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently until the chicken is golden and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.
       In a saucepan, stir together the cornstarch and cold chicken broth. Bring to boil, stirring constantly. Boil 1 minute. Mix in 1 cup of the cheese, the salad dressing, sour cream, chiles, 1/4 cup of the olives and parsley. Stir the sauce until smooth.
      Remove 1 cup of sauce and stir into the chicken mixture. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the chicken mixture into each tortilla; roll to enclose. Place the tortillas seam side down in a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Pour the remaining sauce over and top with the remaining cheese and olives. Bake, uncovered, for 25 to 35 minutes.
