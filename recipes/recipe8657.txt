GROUND MEAT AND GRAVY


1/2  lb. very lean ground beef
1/2  yellow or white onion, chopped
1 small  can evaporated milk
1  Tbsp. cornstarch (to thicken the gravy)

	Brown the meat and onions until the meat is almost done.
	Mix the cornstarch and canned milk and add to meat and onions. Add water or low-fat milk to get the gravy consistency you like. Add salt and pepper to taste.
	This is great over potatoes or leftover biscuits.
