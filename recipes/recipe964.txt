WINE SOUP


1  qt. red or white wine*
2  c. water
1  stick cinnamon
4  whole cloves
5  egg yolks
5  tsp. sugar

      Bring the wine, water and spices to boil.  Strain.  Beat the egg yolks with sugar until lemon colored and slowly add the hot wine mixture, beating constantly until a thick foam forms at the top.  Be careful not to curdle the yolks.  Serve with wafers.
      *If you use red wine, do not use egg yolks.  Cover 1/2 cup Sago with 2 quarts boiling water and cook for 20 minutes, stirring well. When tender, add grated lemon rind, 4 whole cloves and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon to the wine and boil for a moment.  Strain and add to the Sago.  Serve in a tureen, passing sugar, cinnamon and grated lemon rind in a sauce bowl.
