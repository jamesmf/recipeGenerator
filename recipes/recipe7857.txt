CHICKEN LOUISIANA


4  tsp. olive oil
1  large green pepper, chopped (about 1 1/4 c.)
1  large onion, chopped (about 1 c.)
1  large celery stalk, diced (about 1/2 c.)
3  cloves garlic, minced
6  chicken breast halves, boned (about 1 1/2 lb.)
1 1/2  tsp. paprika
1/4 to 1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper, ground
24  oz. stewed tomatoes (low sodium preferred)
1 1/2  tsp. dried rosemary
3/4  tsp. dried marjoram
1  to 2 bay leaves
1 1/2  Tbsp. flour
1/3  c. chicken broth or water

      Using a heavy skillet, saut√© onion, green pepper, celery and garlic in 2 teaspoons olive oil until the onion is soft - about 5 minutes.  Remove vegetables from the skillet and place in a dish. Add 2 teaspoons olive oil to the skillet, sprinkle the chicken breasts with the paprika and cayenne pepper and cook in skillet on medium high heat, turning as needed; cook for about 5 minutes. Add back about half of the cooked vegetables to the chicken.  Add the tomatoes, rosemary, marjoram, and bay leaves; reduce the heat, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes or until the chicken is fork-tender.  Whisk together the flour and chicken broth (or water), add to the skillet and stir the mixture constantly until it has thickened - about 3 minutes.  Add the remaining cooked vegetables to the mixture and heat for a couple of minutes. Remove the bay leaves and serve with or over rice.
