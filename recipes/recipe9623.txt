SWEET AND SOUR MEATBALLS


1  lb. ground beef
1/2  lb. hot sausage
1/2  medium onion, chopped fine
1  tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1/2  dozen saltine crackers
1  egg
  salt & pepper to taste

      Mix all ingredients together well. Shape into balls and brown. Serve with Kraft Barbecue sauce or make your own sweet & sour sauce by combining 1 cup mustard & 2 cups apple jelly. I prefer the apple jelly/ mustard sauce.
      If you double the recipe, double everything but the onion. A double recipe is a crock pot almost full.
      Can also use sliced sausage or little sizzler sausage with the Apple/Mustard Sauce.
