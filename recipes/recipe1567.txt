CHRISTMAS DAMPER


2  c. self-rising flour
1/2  tsp. salt
2  tsp. sugar
1  Tbsp. butter
1  c. milk or water (enough to make a medium or soft dough)
1  tsp. bicarbonate soda

      Rub the butter into the flour.  Knead.  Mould into a Christmassy shape (a wreath or a star).  Bake in hot oven (or in ashes if you are cooking it in a fire).  Cook for 20 minutes until brown.  Serve with butter and jam, honey or golden syrup.
