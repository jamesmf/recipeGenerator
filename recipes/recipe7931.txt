AROZ SAUDI
(Fragrant Saudi Rice)  

1  lb. lean meat, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
3  Tbsp. butter
1/2  tsp. each, cloves, cinnamon, salt, and pepper
1  Tbsp. ground cardamom
1/4  cup chopped onions
1  Tbsp. crushed garlic
1/2  Tbsp. melted butter
1/2  cup raisins
2  Tbsp. tomato paste
3  cups Basmati rice, soaked for 15 minutes, then drained
1/4  cup each, pine nuts and almonds, toasted

      Melt butter and brown meat evenly on all sides. Add cloves, cinnamon, salt, pepper and ground cardamom to meat and stir-fry about 10 minutes. Pour three cups boiling water over meat and cover.  Let cook for one hour on a medium-high heat, until meat is done.  Measure the broth left in a measuring cup. Add water to have a total of 3-1/2 cups liquid.
       Stir onions and garlic with 1/2 Tbsp. hot melted butter, until slightly brown. Add the meat and the liquid to the onion mixture. Stir in tomato paste. Let mixture boil then add the rice and raisins.
      Cover pan tightly and reduce heat to low, putting a thin layer of tin under the pan to prevent the rice from burning. Let rice cook for 30 minutes. Open the pan and stir just the top layer. Check a few grains to see if rice is cooked. You may need a few extra minutes cooking time.
      When ready to serve, carefully mix rice, so as not to break the grains.  Garnish with toasted pine nuts and almonds.  Serve with laban (yogurt) and mixed green salad.
