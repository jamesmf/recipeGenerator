LEMON SHERBET


1  qt. apple juice
5 to 6  Tbsp. honey
4  lemons

      Juice the lemons and for an extra tart taste, also grate the peel.  In a medium size bowl, combine apple juice, lemon juice, lemon peel and honey.  Freeze until solid, about 3 or 4 hours. Using a spatula, break the frozen sherbet into chunks.  In a food processor, blend the chunks until smooth and creamy.
      Note:  For Strawberry-Lemon Sherbet, add 1 pint strawberries and 1 or 2 more tablespoons of honey.
