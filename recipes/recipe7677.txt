NO COOK LASAGNA


1/2  lb. box lasagna noodles
2  lb. hamburger, browned and drained
32  oz. jar (1 qt.) Prego or homemade sauce
15  oz. jar (1 pt.) tomato sauce
1/2  c. water (to rinse out jars)
1 large  carton small curd cottage cheese
1  (8 oz.) cream cheese (optional)
1/4  c. water
  shredded Mozzarella cheese

      Mix meat with next 3 ingredients.  In separate bowl mix next 3 ingredients.  Layer in 9 x  13-inch  pan;  meat  sauce first, then cheese mixture, then  raw  noodles,  then  cheese mixture, then  meat.  I  usually  make  2  layers.  Top  with shredded Mozzarella cheese.  Cover  and  refrigerate 24 hours. Bake at 350 degrees; for at least 1 hour.
      Note:  I usually omit 1 pint of sauce and add 1 pint of water.
