FUDGE - TWO TONE

Dark Layer:
2  c. sugar
1  c. milk
1/8  lb. butter
1 1/2  oz. sq.  Baker's chocolate (unsweetened)
1/2 (18 oz.)  jar peanut butter (I use Jif)
1/2 (7 oz.)  jar Kraft Marshmallow Creme

 
Light Layer:
2  c. sugar
1  c. milk
1/8  lb. butter
1/2 (18 oz.)  jar peanut butter (I use Jif)
1/2 (7 oz.)  jar Kraft Marshmallow Creme

      Cook dark fudge first.  Combine ingredients in large pan and boil until it forms a soft ball when a small amount is dropped in cold water.  Remove from heat; add 1/2 (18 ounce) jar of peanut butter (I use Jif) and 1/2 (7 ounce) jar Kraft Marshmallow Creme. Stir until smooth.  Pour into 9 x 13-inch pan that has been buttered or sprayed with cooking spray.  Repeat instructions for light color, but do not use baking chocolate.  Pour on top of dark layer.  Let cool for about 2 hours and cut.
