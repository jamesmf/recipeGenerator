PAUL'S POTATO SALAD


5  medium potatoes
1  dz. large eggs (or to taste)
1 small  can sliced black olives (mostly drained)
1 small  can sliced green olives (mostly drained)
1  bunch green onions, thinly sliced
  2-3 celery stalks, chopped
1 -12  oz. jar mayonnaise
  Mustard to taste
  Salt, pepper, and Cajun seasonings to taste

      Boil clean unpeeled potatoes and eggs together until potatoes are to desired firmness.  Cool potatoes and eggs in cool water until comfortable to handle.  Rub the peeling off potatoes using fingers (faster than with knife!).  Remove eggshells from eggs. Dice or mash eggs and potatoes in large bowl along with rest of ingredients and mix well.  Chill (or serve room temperature) and serve.  Even better the next day!
