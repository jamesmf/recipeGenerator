CHEESE AND CHIVE BISCUITS


1 1/4  c. all-purpose flour
1/2  c. unprocessed oat bran
1  Tbsp. minced fresh parsley
1 1/2  tsp. baking powder
2  tsp. minced fresh chives
1/8  tsp. dried whole oregano
2  Tbsp. unsalted margarine, softened
3/4  c. low-fat cottage cheese
2  egg whites, lightly beaten
1  Tbsp. all-purpose flour

      Combine  first  6  ingredients  in a large bowl. With a pastry blender,  cut  in  margarine  until  mixture resembles coarse meal.  Stir in cottage cheese and egg whites just until dry ingredients  are  moistened.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon flour evenly over work surface. Turn dough out onto floured surface and  knead lightly  3  to  4  times.  Roll  dough to 7/8-inch thickness. With a 2-inch biscuit cutter, cut rounds and place on  a  baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal.  Bake at 400 degrees; for 10 to 13 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve warm.  Yields 1 dozen.
