LEMON CHICKEN


2  lbs. chicken breasts, cut in small pieces
1  onion, sliced
2  Tbsp. oil
  Salt to taste
  Cayenne pepper to taste
  Black pepper to taste
2  Tbsp. each, garlic and ginger paste
  Juice of 1 large lemon
  Pinch turmeric
2  cups sour cream

      Heat the oil and add the sliced onion.  Once the onion is brown, add the chicken, salt, cayenne, black pepper, garlic and ginger paste.  Cook over low heat to prevent the chicken from becoming tough.
      Once the excess water has dried from the chicken mixture, add the lemon juice to it.  Cook over low heat for about 10 minutes. Add turmeric to create a yellow look.  Let the chicken cool.  Then add the 2 cups sour cream, (this will prevent it from curdling).
       When ready to serve, heat the mixture on low for about 10 minutes.  Do not over-cook.
