CORN FRITTERS


1  can corn or 2 c. fresh corn, cut off cob
1  c. flour
1  tsp. baking powder
1/2  tsp. salt
1  Tbsp. sugar
1/2  tsp. paprika
2  eggs, separated

      When you pick the corn, have a big pot of water boiling before you leave to go to the garden.  Pick the corn and run back to the house, shucking the corn as you go.  Drop the ears of corn into the boiling water and let boil for 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove from the water, butter well, sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Enjoy!
