ENCHILADA CASSEROLE CON CROCKPOT


2  small onions, chopped
2  cloves of garlic
6  boneless, skinless chicken breast, cooked and chopped
1  pkg. taco seasoning mix
2  tsp. cumin
1 (28 oz.)  can green enchilada sauce
12  corn tortillas
12  oz. low fat Cheddar cheese

	In a skillet, saut√© 1/2 onion in about a tablespoon of oil. Cook for 2 minutes and add garlic.	Cook 2 minutes more and add chicken, taco mix, and cumin.  Mix well, set aside.  In a blender, add the rest of the onion and the can of enchilada sauce.  Blend until fully mix. In Crock Pot-insert, pour about 1/2 cup sauce on the bottom of the pan and begin building casserole.  Start with sauce, then put on tortilla, then a layer of chicken mixture, then a layer cheese. Repeat this pattern until finished.  Pour the rest of the sauce evenly over the top and sprinkle a little cheese on the top just before serving.  A Great dish if you are busy all day.  If you don't have a Crock Pot, you can cook this in a dish. Follow the same procedure except cook in the oven at 350 degrees; until bubbling and casserole is completely hot.  Hope you enjoy, we have!
