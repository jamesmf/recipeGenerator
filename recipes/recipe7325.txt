MICROWAVE SALMON


4  (2 1/2 oz.) salmon steaks
  vegetable cooking spray
  lemon juice or lime juice
  lemon pepper

      Place steaks in microwave-safe casserole.  Squeeze lemon juice over steaks.  Generously sprinkle lemon pepper seasoning over steaks and cover.  Microwave on HIGH about 2 minutes.  Turn steaks; repeat with lemon juice and lemon pepper.  Cook another 2 minutes. Check for doneness and serve.  If thicker steaks, may need a few more seconds of cooking.  Steaks freeze well and when heated in microwave, taste fresh.  Serves 4.
      You may use the same seasoning for orange roughy or croppie.
