SIMMERING CHICKEN STRAWBERRY KABOBS


1  c. lemon juice
2 -8  oz. cans pineapple chunks, juice reserved
  salt and pepper to taste
2  tsp. ground cinnamon
3  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed
1  c. butter, melted
2  Tbsp. brown sugar
1  tsp. ground nutmeg
24  large strawberries

      In a shallow glass bowl combine lemon juice, juice from pineapple can, salt, pepper and 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  Mix together. Add cubed chicken and marinate for 1 hour in the refrigerator. Preheat grill to medium heat.  In a small bowl combine the melted butter or margarine, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, brown sugar and nutmeg. Lightly oil grate.  Using metal or soaked wooden skewers arrange chicken, pineapple chunks and strawberries on each stick (approximately 4 to 6 pieces of each item per skewer).  Brush kabobs with butter or margarine mixture place on grill and cook, turning on all sides, until chicken is cooked through and strawberries are sizzling, approximately 8 to 10 minutes.
      You may want to spice the chicken up a bit more to add to the contrast between the meat and the fruit. Try adding some crushed chilies to your chicken marinade.
