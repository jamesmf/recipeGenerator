MARINATED BABY CARROTS


1  lb. bag peeled baby carrots
2  bay leaves
1/2  c. distilled white vinegar
1/4  c. water
3  Tbsp. sugar
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. mustard seeds
1/2  tsp. dry dill weed
1/4  tsp. crushed red pepper
1/4  tsp. dill seeds
1  clove garlic, minced or pressed

      Arrange whole carrots in a vegetable steamer.  Cover and steam over boiling water until just tender when pierced (10-12 minutes).  Plunge into cold water to cool quickly; then drain. Arrange carrots vertically in a clean 1-pint jar that is about the same height as carrots.  Tuck in bay leaves.  In a bowl, stir together vinegar, water, sugar, salt, mustard seeds, dill weed, red pepper, dill seeds, and garlic until sugar is dissolved.  Pour over carrots, cover tightly, and refrigerate for at least 2 days or up to 3 weeks.  Makes 1 pint.
