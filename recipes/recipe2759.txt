SLUSH MIX


1 large  can orange juice or limeade
1 large  can lemonade
2  c. strong tea
1 1/2  c. sugar
1  c. bourbon (optional)
7  c. water

      Boil sugar and water.  In large half gallon pail or container, mix all ingredients thoroughly.  Place in freezer and stir occasionally for 2 days before serving.  Mixture will freeze into a "slush" that can be scooped with ice cream scoop into glasses.  Add 7-Up or Squirt and it's a tasty holiday beverage.
