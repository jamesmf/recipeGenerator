POTATO-CHEESE CHOWDER


2  c. diced raw potatoes
1  c. water
4  chicken bouillon cubes
1/4  c. fine chopped onion
4  Tbsp. butter
4  Tbsp. flour
2  c. milk
1/4  tsp. pepper
1 1/2  c. fine grated Cheddar cheese

      Cook potatoes, bouillon cubes and onion in water until tender; drain, saving cooking potato water.  Melt in saucepan, the butter.  Sprinkle in flour and let bubble.  On low heat, slowly stir in potato water, milk and pepper.  Cook over moderate heat until bubbling, thick and smooth, stirring constantly, adding more milk if needed.  Turn heat to low and simmer 2 minutes.  Add cheese and stir until melted.  Stir in potatoes; mash lightly and heat well.
