CHICKEN TETRAZZINI


1 whole broiler-fryer chicken plus 1  pkg. chicken breasts, skin removed
1  can (7-oz.) diced mild green chiles
1  can (4-oz.) sliced mushrooms, drained
1  can condensed cream of mushroom soup
2  cans condensed cream of chicken soup
1/2  lb. each of grated American and cheddar cheeses
1  pkg. (16-oz.) spaghetti or linguine pasta, uncooked
  Lemon pepper and salt to taste

      Place chicken in Dutch oven, cover with water, and simmer until tender.  Remove chicken from pot (reserving cooking broth) to cool. Cook pasta in the reserved chicken broth; drain.  Remove chicken from bones and cut into bite-size pieces.
      Place drained pasta in a large bowl with chicken, green chiles, mushrooms, cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, and cheeses.  Mix well and add salt and pepper to taste.  Spoon into a lightly greased 9-inch by 13-inch baking pan and spread remaining can of cream of chicken soup over top.  Bake at 375 degrees; about 1 hour uncovered, or until hot and sauce is bubbly.
