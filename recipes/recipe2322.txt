FRIED OKRA
(Yellow Straight or Crookneck or Zucchini)  
Fried Green Tomatoes:

      Follow the recipe for Fried Okra.  Use medium sized, firm green tomatoes.  Don't salt until almost done.  Salt pulls moisture out of vegetables and makes too much liquid in the pan when frying. Try frying some tomatoes that have started to "turn" in with the green ones.  Red ones change the flavor somewhat.  I've had several people try my fried green tomatoes that were skeptical.  They changed their minds right quick!
Fried Summer Squash:

      Cook squash like you would okra (see recipe).  Pick small squash if possible.  If larger, you may want to scrape out the seeds.  Mama sometimes added a cup of sliced onion to squash when she fried it.  Like okra, home fried squash doesn't come out in solid slices all coated nicely.  They kind of merge and blend.  So, be careful how you stir it that you don't break it up too much.
