IKE'S JERKY RECIPE

Liquid (1 Cup Will Do 5 to  10 Pounds Meat):
3/4  c. soy sauce
1/8  c. liquid smoke
1/8  c. hickory seasoning

 
Topping (1/4 Cup Mix Will do 5 to 10 Pounds Meat):
1/5  c. canning salt
1  Tbsp. table salt
1  Tbsp. Watkins and Lawry's seasoning salt
1  tsp. each onion and garlic salt

      Cut meat strips 3/16 to 1/4-inch thick. Trim excess fat from meat. Mix liquid in bowl. Drag strips through liquid and place in nonmetal pan which can be covered. Sprinkle the salt mixture generously over each layer of meat. Cover pan and leave meat to marinate overnight in refrigerator, longer if more flavor is desired. Place strips in single layer with openings for air movement, either in a dehydrator or in oven. Dehydrate until all juice is gone and meat is leathery.
