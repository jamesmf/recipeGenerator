SALAD SUPREME


2  c. chopped apples
1  c. shredded cheese
1  c. colored small marshmallows
1 medium  can diced pineapple, drained and set aside for later use
1  pkg. lemon or lime jello
1/2  pt. whipping cream

      Take liquid from pineapple and enough water to dissolve jello according to package. Put the jello in the refrigerator until it thickens. Shred cheese and cut apples into bite sizes; you can leave the peel of the apples on to give color, if you like.
       Whip the cream and mix all together with fruit, then fold into thickened jello. Set in refrigerator until it thickens and is ready to serve.
