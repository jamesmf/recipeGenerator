BEAN SALAD


1 (16 oz.)  can cut green beans
1 (16 oz.)  can white wax beans
1 (16 oz.)  can Italian beans
1 (16 oz.)  can pinto beans
1 (16 oz.)  can red kidney beans
1  c. diced celery
1  small onion, chopped
3/4  c. vinegar
3/4  c. sugar

  salt and pepper to taste

      Drain beans. Add celery, onion, salt and pepper. Toss lightly. Mix oil, sugar and vinegar. Pour over bean mixture. Let set overnight in the refrigerator. Drain and serve.
      Alternatives I sometimes use are canned green limas, sliced raw carrot, sliced cucumber, chopped bell pepper and canned corn.
