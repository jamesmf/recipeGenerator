SOFT CLAY


2 1/2  c. flour
1/2  c. salt
1  Tbsp. alum
3  Tbsp. corn oil
30  drops food coloring
2  c. boiling water

      Mix flour, salt and alum together in a bowl.  Add oil and colored hot water.  Mix everything until it is cool enough for you to use.  If clay dries out, wrap in a damp cloth, put in a plastic bag and let stand for a couple of days.
      Note:  This clay stays soft so it can be reused.
