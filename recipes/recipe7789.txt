MEAT BALLS


3  c. biscuit mix
1  lb. mild sausage
2  c. shredded cheese
1/4  c. water

      Mix all ingredients together to form dough. Roll into bite-size balls. Bake at 350 degrees; for 10 to 15 minutes. Makes about 30 balls. Serve hot. Freezes well also.
       Use ungreased cookie sheet for baking these. Turn over balls about halfway through baking period so all will be evenly brown.
