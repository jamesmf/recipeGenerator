DAUBE
(Pot Roast Stew)  

2 1/2  lb. rump roast or leg of lamb
6  whole garlic cloves
6  whole cardamom seeds
6  whole cloves
1 (8 oz.)  can tomato sauce
4  c. water
1  tsp. salt
2  Tbsp. white vinegar
4  medium potatoes, skinned and cubed

      Make 6 deep cuts with a sharp knife into the rump roast (or leg of lamb).  Each cut about 2-inches long.  Fill each cut with one of each:  a garlic clove, a cardamom and a clove.  In a 12-quart pot, mix tomato sauce, water, salt and vinegar.  Add the meat.  Bring to a boil on high heat.  Reduce heat to low and let cook, covered, for 1 to 2 hours or until meat can be cut with a spoon.  Turn meat over twice in the process.  Add more water, if needed.  Add the potatoes.  Let cook for another 30 minutes.  Serve with cooked rice.
