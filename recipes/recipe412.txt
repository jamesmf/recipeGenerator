FRUITSICLES


1  apple
1  banana
1  orange
8  to 10 chunks canned pineapple
1  pkg. frozen berries with juice

      You will also need paper cups and ice cream sticks or straws.
      Peel the apple, orange and banana.  Cut up all of the fruit and combine in a blender and puree.  Pour juice into paper cups and cover with tinfoil.  Poke ice cream sticks or straws through the top to make handles.  Freeze.  To remove a Fruitsicle from the cup, hold it by the stick and dip it about halfway into a dish of warm water.  It should then slide out of the cup with ease.  Makes 1 dozen.
