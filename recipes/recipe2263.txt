      In a 3-quart casserole dish, combine water, bouillon granules, thyme, rosemary and bay leaves.  Rinse chicken; pat dry.  Place chicken breast side down in casserole.  Cook, covered, on 100% power (High) 10 minutes.  Turn chicken over.  If using new potatoes, peel a strip around the center; arrange potatoes, onions and carrots around chicken.  Cook, covered, on 50% power (Medium), 30 to 40 minutes or until done, drumsticks move easy in the sockets and vegetables are tender, giving dish a half turn and rearranging vegetables once.  Transfer chicken and vegetables to a platter; keep warm.  Skim fat from pan juices.  Remove bay leaves.  Measure 1 cup pan juices into a 4-cup glass.  Combine the buttermilk and flour; stir into measure.  Cook on High, uncovered, for 3 to 4 minutes or until thickened and bubbly, stirring every minute. Sprinkle chicken with paprika.  Spoon some of the gravy over meat and vegetables.  Garnish with parsley if desired.  Pass remaining gravy.  Makes 6 servings.
