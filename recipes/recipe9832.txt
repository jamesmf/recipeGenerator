MUSHROOM CASSEROLE


3  lb. cleaned fresh mushrooms
1  large onion, chopped
1 (6 oz.)  box chicken stuffing mix
1  stick margarine
1/2  lb. Velveeta cheese, shredded
1  pt. half and half

      Cook and cover mushrooms, butter and onion on low heat in a 5-quart Dutch oven for 1/2 hour.  In a 2-quart casserole, put 1/3 of mushrooms, 1/3 of cheese and half of stuffing mix (mix stuffing and seasoning together, dry).  Repeat these layers, topping with mushrooms and cheese.  Do not use all of the mushroom juice; leave room for half and half.  Pour half and half on finished casserole. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees; for 1/2 hour until set and cheese is melted.
