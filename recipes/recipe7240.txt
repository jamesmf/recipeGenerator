TEXAS BEEF FAJITAS


4 or 5  Tbsp. lime juice (fresh or reconstituted)
1  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
2  cloves garlic, finely minced
1 1/2  lb. skirt steak
3  Tbsp. vegetable oil
2  medium onions, sliced (not chopped)
2  large green peppers, cut into 1/4-inch strips
12  flour tortillas
  fresh cilantro (optional)

      Combine lime juice, garlic and Worcestershire sauce. Marinate steak in this mixture at least 3 hours or overnight. Drain meat well and grill over charcoal until barely medium-rare.
      Meanwhile, saut√© green peppers and onions in the vegetable oil in a large skillet. Can use an electric skillet which is just put in the middle of the table. Set on "warm, " as a serving dish. Cut the grilled meat into very narrow strips (about 1/4-inch). Add to skillet when peppers and onions are about cooked. Stir and cook a little longer until all is done.
      Serve sizzling hot with flour tortillas (also heated), salsa, guacamole and refried beans. The fresh cilantro is optional but makes the fajitas even better.
       Everyone makes their own. Just place about 2 tablespoons of meat mixture on a flour tortilla and add salsa and a few leaves of fresh cilantro; roll and eat! Good! Serves 6.
Fresh Tomato Salsa:
2  large ripe (firm) tomatoes, peeled and seeded
  salt and pepper to taste
1/4  c. onion, finely chopped
1  jalapeno pepper, finely chopped (fresh or canned)

      Chop tomatoes to fine pieces and add all other ingredients. Let set at least an hour.
