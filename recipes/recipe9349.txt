SOUPER MEAT LOAF


1 10 3/4  oz. can cream of mushroom soup
1  pouch Campbell's onion soup
2  lb. ground beef
1/2  c. dry bread crumbs
1/4  c. water

      Mix 1/2 cup of mushroom soup, onion soup mix, beef, egg and bread crumbs.  In a 2 quart oblong baking dish, firmly shape into 8 X 4 inch loaf.  Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 20 minutes or until done.  To make the gravy, spoon off the fat, reserving 1 to 2 tablespoons of drippings.  In a 1 quart saucepan, combine remaining mushroom soup, water and drippings.  Over low heat, warm gravy thoroughly, stirring occasionally.  Serve over meat loaf. Option:  Mushrooms can be added to the gravy. If you've got a gravy lover, add an extra can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy mix.
