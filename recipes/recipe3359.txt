FLORENTINE ARTICHOKE DIP


1  pkg. (10-oz.) frozen chopped spinach, thawed
2  jars (6 1/2-oz. each) marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
2  pkg. (8-oz. each) cream cheese, softened
1  c. shredded Parmesan cheese
1/2  c. mayonnaise
3  large garlic cloves, pressed
2  Tbsp. lemon juice
1 1/2  c. French bread crumbs
2  Tbsp. butter, melted

      Drain spinach; press between layers of paper towels to remove excess moisture.  Pulse pieces of French bread in a food processor until coarse crumbs form.  Measure crumbs, and repeat procedure until you have 1 1/2 cups.  Combine spinach, artichoke hearts, and next 5 ingredients in a bowl, stirring well.  Spoon into a lightly greased 11-inch by 7-inch baking dish.  Combine breadcrumbs and butter; sprinkle over spinach mixture.  Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees; for 25 minutes. Serve with assorted crackers or breadsticks. Yield:  4 cups.
