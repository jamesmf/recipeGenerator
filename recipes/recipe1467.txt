GRILLED AMBERJACK


4  (1-inch thick) amberjack fillets (about 6 oz. each)
2 to 3  Tbsp. fresh lime juice
1 1/2  Tbsp. soy sauce
1  to 2 garlic cloves, minced
2  tsp. powdered ginger
1  tsp. Oriental sesame oil
1  tsp. hot sauce or pinch of dried red pepper flakes
1/2  tsp. sugar

      Arrange fish in shallow glass dish.  Whisk remaining ingredients together in a small bowl.  Pour marinade over fish and turn to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap and marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature or 1 hour in the refrigerator, turning once or twice and spooning marinade over all pieces of fish.  Spray Pam nonstick vegetable oil on a clean grill and place fish skin side down, or place on foil.  Cook 4 minutes per side or when fish flakes.  (Cooking time might be longer on foil.)
