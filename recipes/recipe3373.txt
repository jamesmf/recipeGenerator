TINY SHRIMP TRIANGLES


1/4  c. green bell pepper, minced
2  Tbsp. onion, minced
2  Tbsp. butter
2  Tbsp. all-purpose flour
1  c. half-and-half cream
2  Tbsp. dry sherry wine
1  can (4 1/2-oz.) tiny shrimp, drained
1  Tbsp. pimiento, finely chopped (optional)
1/4  tsp. salt
1  pkg. (17 1/4-oz.) Pepperidge Farm frozen puff pastry sheets
1  egg, beaten

      Saut√© green pepper and onion in butter until tender.  Stir in flour and cook 1 minute longer, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat and gradually blend cream and sherry.  Return to heat and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil.  Remove from heat and stir in shrimp, pimiento and salt.  Set aside to cool completely.
      Thaw pastry 20 minutes; unfold.  Roll each sheet on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch square; cut each into sixteen 3-inch squares.  Top each square with some of the shrimp mixture.  Brush edges of pastry with egg mixture; fold in half to form triangles. Press edges together with the tines of a fork. Brush lightly with more egg and transfer to ungreased baking sheets.  Bake at 400 degrees; for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown and puffed.
