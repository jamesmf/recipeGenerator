PIZZA DUNKS


1  loaf Italian bread, unsliced
1  c. Mozzarella cheese, shredded
1 large or 2 small  jars pizza sauce

      Slice bread lengthwise, then into strips and finally into cubes about 1 to 2-inches square.  Place on cookie sheet and heat in a 425 degrees; oven until tan.  Remove and put in a bread basket.  Put sauce in baking dish and heat in microwave until hot.  Remove and sprinkle cheese on top.  When cheese melts, put on table with bread.  Give each child a fork and let him or her stab a cube of bread and dip it into sauce.  No mess and no waste!
