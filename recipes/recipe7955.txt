HONEY MUSTARD CHICKEN


4  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, slightly pounded
1  cup mayonnaise
1/4  cup honey
1  Tbsp. Dijon style mustard
1/2  tsp. onion powder
1/8  tsp. cayenne pepper

      Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Place the chicken breasts on a 10 x 15 inch rimmed cookie sheet that has been coated with nonstick cooking spray.  In a small bowl, combine the remaining ingredients; mix well.  Spread the mixture evenly over the chicken breasts.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until topping is golden and no pink remains in the chicken.
