TURKEY WITH SALSA MOLE POBLANO

Mole Sauce:
3  dried ancho chilies
3  dried pasilla chilies
2  Tbsp. peanut oil
1  medium yellow onion, peeled and chopped
2  garlic cloves, minced
1  red sweet bell pepper, chopped
1  green sweet bell pepper, chopped
1  c. whole canned tomatoes
3/4  tsp. ground cinnamon
1/2  tsp. ground cloves
1/4  tsp. ground coriander
1/2  tsp. ground anise
1/4  tsp. ground cumin
1  dry wheat tortilla, torn into pieces
1/4  c. sesame seed
1/4  c. raisins
2  c. chicken or turkey broth
2 (1 oz.)  sq. semi-sweet baking chocolate

      Brown the turkey thighs in a bit of oil in a very heavy skillet.  Place them in a kettle, barely covered with water.  Bring to a boil, cover and turn down the heat, and simmer for 40 minutes. Turn off the heat, cover the pot and leave the turkey in the broth for another 45 minutes.
      For the Sauce:  Stem and seed the chilies and tear them into pieces.  Be careful with this as the chili oil that you will get on your hands will burn your eyes if you should rub them.  Discard the seeds unless you wish for a much hotter dish.  Place the pieces in a small bowl, cover with boiling water and allow to sit for 30 minutes.  Discard all the water except 1/4 cup.  Heat oil in a skillet and saut√© the onion and garlic until limp.  In a blender or food processor, combine the chilies and two bell peppers, onion and garlic, tomatoes and spices.  Puree until smooth.  Then add the tortilla pieces, sesame seed and raisins.  Puree again until all is quite smooth.  Add the chicken or turkey broth.  Simmer this mixture in a saucepan for 10 minutes.  Add the chocolate and stir until the chocolate melts.  Remove the turkey from the kettle, slice and place on a platter.  Mole sauce is served over the turkey with additional sauce served on the side.  Try this with rice and chilies with cheese and a green salad with garlic dressing.  Wine suggestion:  heavy Pinot Noir.  Serves 8 to 10.
