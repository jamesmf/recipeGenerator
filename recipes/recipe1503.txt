1/2  clove garlic, minced
2  Tbsp. butter, cut into bits
2  medium zucchini, 1/8-inch slices
1/2  tsp. thyme leaves

      Tear off a length of aluminum foil.  Place onion in center of foil in single layer.  Top with zucchini, cheese, seasonings and butter.  Bring four corners of foil up together in pyramid shape. Fold openings together loosely for heat circulation and expansion. Seal by folding over ends and pressing to package.  Grill over medium hot coals 20 minutes.  Carefully open bundle; add tomatoes. Re-seal.  Grill 20 to 30 minutes longer or until zucchini is tender and tomatoes are heated through.
