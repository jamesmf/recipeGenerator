2 (15 oz.)  cans sliced beets
1/4  tsp. salt
1 1/3  Tbsp. sugar
  pickling spice
3  cloves
3/4  c. vinegar

	Drain beets and reserve beet liquid. Combine beet liquid and enough water to make 2 cups. Add salt, sugar, and vinegar to the liquid.  Stir.  Place mixture in a pan over low heat. Bring to a boil. Turn off stove; add cloves and pickling spice. Pour hot mixture over the sliced beets.  Let cool then cover and chill. Beets will keep several days in the refrigerator.  They are an excellent side for cabbage, green beans, and other country style cooked vegetables.
