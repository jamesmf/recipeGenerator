SANTA FE SOUP


1.5  lb. lean hamburger
1  diced onion
1 (16 oz.)  can Ranch Style beans
1 (16 oz.)  can corn
1 (16 oz.)  can stewed tomatoes, cut up in smaller pieces
1  can Ro-Tel (original hot, regular or mild, whatever your family likes; I use regular)
1  lb. Velveeta cheese

      You will need a crock-pot. (I cook in larger pan and then transfer to crock-pot; faster.)
      Cook hamburger and onions. Add all ingredients except cheese (do not drain vegetables; use juice). Heat meat and vegetables until ingredients are hot. Cut up cheese in smaller squares and add after the rest is hot. Stir frequently until melted.
       I serve with saltine crackers; could use corn chips or Doritos.
