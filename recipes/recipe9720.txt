CHICKEN WITH LEEK AND MUSHROOM SAUCE


4  chicken breasts, pounded flat
3  tsp. olive or canola oil, divided
1/2  c. sliced leeks
2  c. sliced mushrooms
1/4  c. brandy
1  c. chicken broth
1  Tbsp. flour

      Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a skillet and saut the chicken until lightly browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from the skillet and keep hot. Heat the other 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in the same skillet used for the chicken (do not wash out in between; you want that great chicken flavor in the bottom of the pan). Add the leeks and cook, stirring for 2 minutes. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes more. Add brandy and cook for 2 minutes. Transfer this to a mixing bowl. Whisk chicken broth with flour and add to the same skillet. Cook, whisking until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Return mushroom mixture, chicken and juices to skillet. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 4 minutes. Serves 4.
