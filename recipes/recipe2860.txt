1  (16 oz.) loaf frozen bread dough
2  Tbsp. butter or margarine, softened
1/4  c. brown sugar
1/2  tsp. ground cinnamon
1/4  c. chopped pecans
1  c. confectioners sugar
4 to 5  tsp. milk

      Thaw frozen dough; roll to 12-inch square.  Cut in 3 strips. Spread butter or margarine down lengthwise center of each strip. Combine brown sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over butter.  Top with chopped pecans.  Bring dough up around filling, sealing edges to form 3 ropes.  Place on greased baking sheet and loosely braid. Let rise until double (about 30 minutes).  Bake at 375 degrees; for 30 to 35 minutes.  Combine confectioners sugar and enough milk to make a thin glaze.  Drizzle over braid while it is still warm. Sprinkle top with red sugar and trim with pecan halves.
