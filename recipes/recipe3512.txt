CHINESE EGGROLLS


2  Tbsp. soy sauce
  Bean sprouts
4  fresh mushrooms, chopped
2  green onions, finely chopped
1/2  cup cooked shrimp, chopped
1/4  cup water chestnuts
1/2  tsp. sugar
1  pkg. skin rolls (eggroll wrappers)
1  Tbsp. sesame oil

      Heat sesame oil in large skillet.  Quickly cook bean sprout over high heat, stirring constantly.  Add 4 fresh mushrooms chopped, water chestnuts, and cook approximately 2 minutes.  Add meat, onions, salt, pepper, soy sauce and sugar. Set aside to cool.
      Work with one eggroll skin at a time.  Cover remaining skins with a dampened towel to keep them pliable.  To fill each roll, place 2 Tbsp. filling just below the center of the eggroll skin. Fold bottom corner up over filling to cover, then fold in the two outside corners.
       Carefully roll the wrapper closed, sealing shut with a bit of beaten egg white.  A thick paste made out of flour and water can also be used to seal eggrolls.
      Heat oil (enough to cover eggrolls) over medium-high heat, and carefully add the eggrolls, one at a time.  Deep-fry about 2-3 minutes, until golden brown on both sides, turning once.
      May be kept warm in 200 degrees;F oven until serving time.  Serve with spicy dipping sauce
