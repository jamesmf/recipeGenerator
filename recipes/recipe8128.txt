BLACK-EYED PEAS AND SAUSAGE


1 (16 oz.)  pkg. dried black-eyed peas
1  ham hock or ham bone
1  c. diced celery
1  c. diced onion
3 large  cloves garlic, diced
  salt and pepper to taste
2  lb. mild or hot sausage
4  large bell peppers, coarsely chopped
4  large tomatoes, chopped
10  c. cooked rice
  red vinegar
  hot pepper sauce
  soy sauce

      Let peas soak overnight. Bring peas to a full boil, then pour peas in a colander and rinse. Fill a large stockpot 3/4 full of water. Add peas, ham hock or bones, celery, onion, garlic, salt and pepper. Cook until tender. While peas are cooking, brown the sausage and cook rice.
       To serve, make a bed of rice on a large platter, hollowing out the middle. Place the drained peas in the bed of rice. Spoon the sausage on top of peas. Cover the remaining rice with bell pepper and place the tomatoes on the top, covering the peas and sausage. Sprinkle with green onions. Offer the remaining ingredients as condiments when serving. Serves 16.
