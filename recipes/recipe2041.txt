STRAWBERRY DIVINITY



3  c. sugar
3/4  c. light corn syrup
3/4  c. strawberry preserves
2  egg whites
1 (3 oz.)  pkg. strawberry jello
1  c. chopped nuts

      Cook preserves over low or medium heat until the mixture gets thin or melts.  Combine sugar, corn syrup and the melted preserves in a heavy saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until sugar dissolves.  If sugar crystals form on sides of pan, wipe them off.  Continue cooking to the hard-ball stage (252 degrees;). Meanwhile, beat egg whites until stiff, but not dry; blend in jello.  When syrup reaches 252 degrees;, pour in a thin stream over egg whites, beating constantly with electric mixer on medium speed. Beat as long as possible, using wooden spoon if mixture becomes too stiff for mixer.  Add nuts and pour into lightly buttered square pan.  When cool and firm, cut into 36 pieces.  If divinity has not hardened by the time it is completely cool, put in the freezer for an hour or so.  Makes about 2 pounds.
