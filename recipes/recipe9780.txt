      Cook chicken in salted water until it falls from bones.  Cool and remove meat from bones, discarding all fat and skin.  Place in baking dish.  Have potatoes, carrots, and onion diced and cooked tender in small amount of salted water.  Add these and peas to meat.  Make a thick sauce of 2  Tbsp. flour and broth, using water from vegetable if there is not too much.  Canned biscuits may be used but they must be patted very thin or may be baked before adding them to the casserole.  Cover top of casserole with biscuits and heat thoroughly, 20 minutes or longer uncovered in a 350 degree oven.
