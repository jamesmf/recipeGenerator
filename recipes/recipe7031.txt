NATCHITOCHES MEAT PIES

Filling:
1 1/2  lb. ground beef
1  c. green onions, chopped
1  tsp. black pepper
1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper
1 1/2  lb. ground pork
1  Tbsp. salt
1  tsp. red pepper
1/3  c. plain flour

      Cook ground beef, ground pork, and seasoning until well done. Sift flour over meat mixture, stirring often until well combined. Remove from heat; place in a colander to drain off excess grease. Allow to cool.
Crust:
2  c. self rising flour
1  egg, beaten
1/3 heaping  c. Crisco, (not melted)
3/4  c. milk

      To make the crust, sift flour and cut in shortening. Add beaten egg and milk. Form dough into a ball. Roll about 1/3 of dough out at a time on a lightly floured surface. Cut dough into 5 inch circles. Place all circles on a cookie sheet, separated by waxed paper.
      To assemble the pies, place a heaping Tbsp. of filling on pastry round. Dampen edge of pastry and fold top over meat mixture. Crimp edges with fork dipped in water. Prick twice on top of pie with fork. Fry in cooking oil until golden brown.
