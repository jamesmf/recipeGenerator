      Remove all fat and membrane from venison, preferably hindquarter.  Coarsely grind and set aside.  Add diced bacon to hot 5 quart or larger dutch oven or heavy pot.  Cook over medium high to high heat until fat is cooked down and bacon crisp.  Add chopped onions to bacon and grease.  Cook while stirring until onions wilt.  Be careful not to burn.  Add minced garlic to onions a minute or so before onions are finished.  Add venison and stir until lightly browned.  Add chopped tomatoes including juice.  Add sugar, cumin, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper and chili powder. Reduce heat and simmer 1 1/2 hours.  Cover pot with top slightly ajar, stir occasionally.  Add a bit of water at any time if chili becomes too thick.  Add drained kidney beans and simmer an additional 30 minutes.  Add chopped green chilies just prior to serving.
