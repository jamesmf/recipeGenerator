TWICE BAKED POTATOES


4  baking potatoes
2  Tbsp. soy margarine
1/2  tsp. sea salt
  dash of paprika
2  Tbsp. soy Parmesan cheese
3  green onions (scallions), thinly sliced
1/2  c. soy margarine, heated
  dash of cayenne pepper
2/3  Tbsp. TVP bacon bits
2/3  Tbsp. soy American cheese

      Wash potatoes.  Pat dry.  Prick each potato with a fork in a few places.  Bake potatoes on a rack at 400 degrees; for about 1 hour or until potatoes are cooked.  Cut a thin slice from top of each potato.  Scoop out the pulp into a bowl.  Mash the potato pulp with the hot soy milk until fluffy.  Beat in soy margarine and scallions.  Add seasoning.  Add TVP based bacon bits into potato mixture.  Spoon potato mixture into shells.  Sprinkle with both cheeses.  Place potatoes on baking sheet.  Bake at 375 degrees; until potatoes are piping hot and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.  Yields 4 servings.
