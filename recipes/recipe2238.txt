"RED EYE" GRAVY


  country ham drippings
1  c. perked coffee

      After frying country ham slices, remove ham from skillet.  Pour one cup fresh perked coffee into the ham drippings.  Let simmer for 1 minute, then pour off into a bowl.  The dark liquid that settles to the bottom is "red eye" gravy.  A great topping for fresh hot biscuits or ham.  When serving, dip from the bottom of the bowl.
