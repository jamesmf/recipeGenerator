CHRISTMAS BUCKEYES


1 1/2  lb. powdered sugar
1 (16 oz.)  jar crunchy peanut butter
1  c. margarine, softened

 
Coating Recipe:
1  (12 oz.) bag chocolate chips
1/5  lb. paraffin

      Position knife blade in food processor bowl.  Add half of powdered sugar, peanut butter and margarine.  Top with cover. Process until thoroughly mixed.  Shape into one inch balls.  Chill. Repeat.  (If using large processor no need to split recipe.)
      Melt chocolate and paraffin in top of double boiler.  Using a toothpick, dip balls into coating, leaving a small portion uncoated to resemble a buckeye.  Store in airtight container.  (It helps to place the balls on a cookie sheet and keep in freezer for about an hour.)  The coating dries faster.
