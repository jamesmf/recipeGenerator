Place over medium heat.  When liquid boils, add mixed tofu patties.  Boil 3 minutes.  Arrange mixed tofu patties on dish.  Top with chicken stock.  Serve while hot.
      Today, hirosu, or ganmodoki as they are called in the Kanto region, are an essential food in any Japanese kitchen.  Deep-frying is the most commonly used method to make hirousu, although one can also fry them in vegetable oil or butter as one would hamburgers.
