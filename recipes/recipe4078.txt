GRAHAM CRACKER MUNCHIES


2  packs graham crackers
1  stick real butter (no substitutes)
1  stick margarine
1/2  c. sugar
1/2  c. chopped nuts (I like to use pecans)

	Break crackers into small pieces and arrange on a foil-lined cookie sheet. Turn the foil up around the edges. Boil the butter, margarine and sugar together for 3 minutes. Pour over the crackers and sprinkle with nuts. Bake 10 minutes at 300 degrees;.
