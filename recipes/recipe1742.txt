PANNEKOEKEN
(Crepes)  

2  c. flour
2  c. milk
1/2  c. melted butter
  pinch of salt
5  eggs
1/4  c. rum or 1 tsp. rum flavoring
3/4  c. sugar

      Mix all of the ingredients to make a fairly thin batter.  Use a dipper or ladle to put 1/2 cupful on a hot griddle using a circular motion.  The Pannekoeken should be quite thin.  It may be turned once for a short cooking period on the flip side.  Griddle should be at medium heat.  Makes about 2 dozen (8-inch) crepes.  Serve with banana sauce.
