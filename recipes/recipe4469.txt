LO-CAL VEGETABLE SOUP


1 large  can tomato juice
1 juice  can of water
6  carrots, sliced or diced
1/2  stalk celery, diced
1/2  head cabbage, shredded
4  to 5 bouillon cubes
  salt and pepper to taste

      Simmer all together about 1 hour.
      NOTES:  We like our vegetables slightly crunchy.
      One large bowl is less than 100 calories.
      We add leftover roast beef.
