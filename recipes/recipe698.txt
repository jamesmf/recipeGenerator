2  c. cream-style cottage cheese
2 (3 oz.)  pkg. cream cheese, softened
1/2  c. finely chopped onion
2  Tbsp. butter or margarine
1 or 2 (3 oz.)  cans chopped mushrooms, drained
1/3  c. dry white wine
1/2  tsp. thyme, crushed
1/4  tsp. salt
  dash of pepper
1 (6 oz.)  can evaporated milk
1 (10 oz.)  pkg. frozen spinach, cooked and well drained
10  oz. spaghetti, cooked and drained
  grated Parmesan cheese (if desired)

      With an electric mixer beat cottage cheese and cream cheese until nearly smooth.  In a saucepan, cook onion in butter or margarine until tender but not brown.  Add mushrooms, wine, thyme, salt and pepper.  Stir in cheese mixture, evaporated milk and drained spinach.  Heat through, but don't let it boil or it will separate.  Place hot spaghetti on large platter and top with sauce; toss gently.  Serves 4 as a main course.
