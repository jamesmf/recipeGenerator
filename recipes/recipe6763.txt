BAKED CHICKEN BREASTS


8  chicken breasts
8  slices bacon
1  pkg. dried beef
1  can cream of mushroom soup
1  c. sour cream

      Line bottom of a 9 x 13-inch baking pan with layer of dried beef. Place 1 slice of bacon inside skinned and boned chicken breast. Spoon over top the mushroom soup and sour cream. Bake, uncovered, at 275 degrees; for 3 hours.
       I have also made this recipe using only 3 chicken breasts and 3 slices of bacon and it works the same.
