      Chop chicken into bite-sized pieces.  Dry with kitchen paper.
      Place a clay pot over high heat for one minute.  Add oil and when smoking, add ginger, garlic and shallots.  Stir-fry with a pair of chopsticks for one minute until fragrant.
      Add chicken and stir-fry for about 2 to 3 minutes until chicken changes color and is slightly browned.  Add oyster sauce and dark soya sauce and stir-fry briefly.
