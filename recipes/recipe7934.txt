BREAKFAST CASSEROLE


  6-8 slices white bread
1/2  cup mozzarella cheese
1/2  cup cheddar cheese
1  lb. sausage, browned and drained
1  1/2 cups milk
1/2  cup mushrooms (optional)
6  eggs

      Place slices of bread in the bottom of a 9 x 13 inch pan. Sprinkle cooked sausage over the bread.  Mix together the milk and eggs.  Pour over sausage and bread.  Top with mushrooms (if desired) and the cheeses.  Cover with plastic wrap and let set in refrigerator overnight so the milk soaks into the bread.  Bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes.
