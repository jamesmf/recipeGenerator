SPINACH MADELEINE


2  pkg. frozen chopped spinach
4  Tbsp. butter
2  Tbsp. flour
2  Tbsp. chopped onion
3/4  tsp. celery salt
3/4  tsp. garlic salt
1  (6 oz.) roll jalapeno cheese
1/2  c. evaporated milk
1/2  c. vegetable liquor
1/2  tsp. black pepper
1  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce

      Cook spinach; drain and reserve liquor.  Melt butter in pan over low heat.  Add flour, stirring until blended and smooth, but not brown.  Add liquor slowly, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Add evaporated milk.  Cook until smooth and thick, continuing to stir.  Add seasoning and cheese which has been cut into small pieces and stir until melted.  Combine with spinach.  Serve immediately or put in casserole and top with buttered bread crumbs.  Keep overnight in refrigerator for improved flavor, then heat in oven and serve.  Serves 6.
