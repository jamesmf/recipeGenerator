CHICKEN AND RICE CASSEROLE


1 (10 oz.)  can cream of chicken soup
1/2  c. mayonnaise
2  c. cooked white rice
2  c. chopped cooked chicken
1  c. frozen peas
1/2  c. chopped onion
1/2  c. chopped green and red bell pepper
1  c. shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1  sheet (1/2 pkg.) frozen puff pastry dough, thawed
1  egg white, lightly beaten

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;.  Spray a large casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.  In a medium bowl, combine soup, milk and mayonnaise.  In another bowl, combine rice, chicken, peas, onion and bell pepper.  Stir soup mixture into chicken mixture.  Add half the Cheddar.  Spoon into casserole.  Sprinkle with remaining Cheddar.  Bake until top is golden, about 25 minutes.
       Roll pastry to 1/8-inch thickness. Using a cookie cutter, mark cutouts in pastry and cut out with knife. Place unbaked cutouts directly on casserole during the last 15 minutes of baking time. Brush tops of cutouts with egg white before baking.
