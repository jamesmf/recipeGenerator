SALSA


3  jalapeno peppers
1  small onion, chopped
1  clove garlic
1  tsp. cilantro or parsley
  Salt, pepper to taste
2  tsp. lime juice
1 lg.  can whole tomatoes

      For chunky style, finely chop onion, garlic, cilantro and peppers.  You may want to remove the seeds from peppers before chopping them, because the more seeds, the hotter the sauce.  Mix together and add the tomatoes, lime juice, salt and pepper.  Mix well until the tomatoes are partially liquefied but lumpy.  For smoother salsa, put all in a blender till smooth.  Keep in refrigerator for 2-3 hours before serving.
