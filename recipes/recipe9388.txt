STUFFED PORK CHOPS


4  pork chops, center cut, 2 inch thick
1  tsp. salt
1  tsp. black pepper
1/2  lb. ground pork
1/4  c. onion, finely chopped
1  Tbsp. garlic, finely minced
2  Tbsp. green onion, finely chopped
1  Tbsp. fresh parsley, finely chopped
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. black pepper
1  tsp. paprika
1/2  tsp. ground sage
1/2  tsp. ground fennel seed

      Wash pork chops, pat dry and sprinkle with salt and black pepper.  Next, with a sharp filet or paring knife, trim off excess fat.  Cut a 1 inch slit into the middle of the front of the pork chop from side to side.  Use the slit to cut a pocket into the pork chop from the bone to about 1/2 inch from the end of the meat.  Your butcher will do this for you.  Next, in a large bowl mix ground pork with all remaining ingredients until all is blended well.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Stuff the pork mixture into the pockets of the pork chops.  Be generous and stuff it in until pork chop expands in the center. If there is any stuffing left, just make them into balls and cook with the pork chops.  Next, spray an oven pan with a vegetable coating and place pork chops into pan with 1 cup water and cover.  Place in oven for 35 minutes, remove cover and bake another 15 minutes.  Serve.
