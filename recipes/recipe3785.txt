  Medium size cucumbers (to fill 4 qt. size jars)
1  onion, sliced
2  celery stalks, quartered
8  heads fresh dill
4  c. white sugar
1/2  c. salt (use good canning salt for best results)
1  qt. vinegar
2  c. water

      Wash cucumbers and cut into chunks, enough to fill 4 quarts. To each jar add 3 or 4 slices of onion, 2 pieces of celery and 2 heads of dill.  Dissolve sugar and salt in vinegar and water; bring to a boil.  Place cucumbers in jars, then cover with hot sugar, salt, vinegar and water.  Seal at once.  For best results, do not use for 30 days.  Makes 4 quarts.
