HERBED MEAT LOAF


1  lb. ground beef
1/2  lb. ground veal
1/2  lb. ground lean pork
2  eggs
1/2  c. fine bread crumbs
3/4  c. chopped parsley
2  Tbsp. fresh basil, finely chopped or 1 Tbsp. dried basil
1/4  c. green pepper, coarsely chopped
1 1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. freshly ground black pepper
  bacon slices (to cover top)

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;. In mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients except the bacon slices. Using the hands, blend well; do not overwork the meat or it will produce a meat loaf that is too tightly packed. Line 9-inch pie plate with aluminum foil and shape the meat mixture into an oval loaf. Place the loaf on the foil and cover with bacon slices. Bake 1 1/2 hours. Serve with mushroom sauce or fresh tomato sauce.
      Hint: Go with the mushroom sauce!
