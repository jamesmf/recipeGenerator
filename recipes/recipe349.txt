LEMON AND ORANGE ROUGHY FILLETS


1  small carrot, finely shredded
1  c. quick-cooking couscous
3/4  tsp. onion salt
1/8  tsp. lemon-pepper seasoning
  dash of ground nutmeg
1  c. water
1  lb. fresh skinless orange roughy, flounder, red snapper or salmon fillets (about 1/2-inch thick)
1/2  lemon
1  tomato (optional)

      Combine  carrot,  couscous,  onion  salt,  lemon-pepper seasoning  and  nutmeg. Add water and stir, then divide into 4 individual  au  gratin  baking  dishes,  sprayed with nonstick coating.  Cut  fish  in  4  equal portions and place on top of couscous  mixture  in each dish, tucking under any thin edges. Cut lemon in 4 slices and place one slice on top of each piece of fish. Cover with foil and refrigerate 3 to 24 hours.
      Bake fish, covered, in a 450 degrees; oven for 18 to 20 minutes (fish should flake easily with a fork).  Cut tomato in wedges and serve with fish (if desired).  Makes 4 servings.
