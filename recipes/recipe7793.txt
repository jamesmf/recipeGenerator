GLAZED SALMON



1/4  c. olive oil
3  Tbsp. molasses
2  cloves garlic, minced
3/4  tsp. grated lemon rind
4  skinless salmon fillet chunks (8 oz. each)

      Combine oil, molasses, garlic and lemon rind. Mix well. Place salmon in shallow dish. Add marinade, turning to coat on all sides. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours, turning often. Broil or barbecue salmon, starting skin side down and turning once, 3 to 4 minutes per side or until fish flakes easily. Brush often with marinade.
