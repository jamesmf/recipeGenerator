WIENER SCHNITZEL
(Breaded Pork Cutlets)  

1  c. lard, heated in skillet until hot
4  to 6 pork cutlets
  enough flour to coat cutlets
2  slightly beaten eggs
1/3  c. milk
1 1/2  c. plain bread crumbs

      Dip cutlets into flour.  Mix eggs and milk.  Dip cutlets into egg-milk mixture.  Carefully coat with bread crumbs, not too heavily.  Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes to seal coating.  Deep-fry cutlets until browned on both sides, about 3 or 4 minutes.  Turn cutlets several times during cooking.  Do not pierce.  Remove cutlets from lard with tongs and drain over pan for a few seconds before removing to absorbent paper.
