1/2  c. onion, chopped fine
1/2  c. mushrooms, chopped fine
1/4  c. diet margarine
1  c. herb-seasoned stuffing mix
1  c. boiling water

      Saut√© celery, onion and mushrooms in margarine until onion is golden.  Add stuffing mix to boiling water.  Toss all together and mix well.
      Optional:  I add 1 egg, which equals 1/4 meat exchange per serving.  This makes 3 1/4 cups.
      Diabetic exchange equals 1 cup, 1/2 bread and 1/2 fat. Contains 57 calories per serving.
