SALMON CROQUETTES


1/4  c. butter
1/2  c. all-purpose flour
1  c. heavy cream
1 1/2  tsp. pepper
1/2  tsp. salt
1  c. dry bread crumbs
2  lb. cooked salmon, skinned, deboned and chilled
2  Tbsp. butter
1  medium onion (yellow), chopped fine
3  Tbsp. all-purpose flour
1/4  c. vegetable oil (for frying)
  parsley sprigs and lemon wedges (for garnish)

      Blend butter and the 1/2 cup flour together in a bowl.  Bring cream to a boil in a small saucepan.  Blend in butter and flour mixture.  Remove from heat.  Add pepper, salt, bread crumbs and salmon.  Mix thoroughly and then spoon into a dish to cool. Meanwhile, heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat; add the 2 tablespoons butter and saut onion until transparent.  Add contents of frying pan to the cooled salmon mixture.  If the mixture appears too dry, add additional cream.  If it appears too soft, add additional bread crumbs.  Form into 6 to 8 patties; dust patties with the 3 tablespoons of flour.  Cook patties in hot vegetable oil over medium heat until cooked through and golden, approximately 10 minutes on each side.  Garnish with parsley and lemon.
