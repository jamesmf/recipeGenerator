CHICKEN SATAY


1/4  c. soy sauce
3  Tbsp. peanut or olive oil
2  medium garlic cloves, finely chopped
2  tsp. curry
2  tsp. sugar
6  to 8 boneless chicken breasts

      Marinate chicken mixture for 24 hours. Drain marinade and cook chicken. Serve with Coconut-Peanut Sauce.
      Whole chicken breasts are nice for main entrees. You may want to marinate strips of chicken to kabob them on the grill or cube the chicken for appetizers. The chicken and the sauce are good hot or cold.
Coconut-Peanut Sauce:
1/2  c. peanuts
1  small onion, cut into chunks
1  medium garlic clove
2  dried hot chili peppers or to taste
1  Tbsp. peanut oil
1  tsp. coriander
1/2  tsp. cumin
3/4  c. coconut milk
1 1/2  Tbsp. brown sugar
1  Tbsp. lemon or lime juice
1  Tbsp. soy sauce

      Combine all ingredients in a blender and puree. Heat mixture in saucepan or microwave until hot.
