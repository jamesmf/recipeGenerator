POT ROAST WITH MUSHROOM GRAVY


1  (3 1/2-lb.) boneless beef rump or chuck roast
2  large garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1  tsp. salt
1  tsp. garlic salt
1  tsp. pepper
1/4  c. flour
3  Tbsp. vegetable oil
2  c. brewed coffee
1 (10 1/2-oz.)  can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
1  large onion, sliced
3  Tbsp. cornstarch
3  Tbsp. cold water

      Cut slits in roast, using a sharp knife; push a garlic slice into each slit.  Sprinkle roast with salts and pepper; lightly dredge in flour, patting off excess.  Brown meat on all sides in hot oil over medium-high heat in a large Dutch oven.  Stir together coffee, undiluted soup, and Worcestershire sauce; pour over roast. Top with onion slices.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 4 hours or until tender.  Transfer roast to a serving platter, reserving drippings in Dutch oven; keep roast warm.  Combine cornstarch and 3 tablespoons cold water, and stir into drippings. Bring mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute or until thickened.  Pour gravy over roast.
