THANKSGIVING TURKEY


  turkey
1  unpeeled quartered apple
3  stalks celery
1  onion

      This is for any size turkey so long as you have a roaster large enough to hold it with the lid tightly fitting; no foil cover please.  It will work with a gas or electric stove if your oven registers the correct temperature.
      Preheat oven to 475 degrees;, very hot.  About nine or ten o'clock, place turkey that has been completely thawed and allowed to come near to room temperature in a covered roaster.  Place an unpeeled quartered apple, 3 stalks of celery and an onion in the cavity. Melt 1 stick of butter and pour over turkey after it has been salted and peppered.  Add 1 quart of warm water.  Cover tightly and bake for 1 hour.
      Turn off oven.  Do not open oven door, leave all night.  In the morning when you look at it, it will be a golden brown.  You will have plenty of broth for dressing and gravy and the tenderest turkey you ever tasted.
