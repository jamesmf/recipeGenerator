RUSSIAN SCALLOPED POTATOES


2  small onions, chopped
4  Tbsp. butter or margarine
1  Tbsp. flour
1/2  c. consomme
1/2  c. sour cream
1  tsp. Worcestershire sauce
2  drops Tabasco sauce
1 (16 oz.)  can white potatoes
2  c. ham, cut into thin strips
2  small dill pickles
  grated Parmesan cheese

      Simmer the onions in half the butter until soft, but not brown. Add the flour; cook 5 minutes, then add consomme, sour cream, Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco sauce.  Continue cooking 10 minutes longer over low heat.  Slice potatoes thin and saut√© in remaining butter about 5 minutes.
      Trim fat from ham and cut ham into strips about 1 x 1/2-inches. Peel the pickles and slice very thin.  Mix all ingredients with the onion sauce carefully, using a fork.  Place all together in a 9 x 9-inch baking dish.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and bake at 350 degrees; for about 20 minutes to one-half hour.  Good with cucumber salad and pumpernickel bread.
