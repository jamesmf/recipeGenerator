SPINY LOBSTER TAILS


6  spiny lobster tails (8 oz. each, fresh or frozen)
1/4  c. butter or margarine, melted
2  Tbsp. lemon juice
1/2  tsp. salt
  melted butter or margarine

      Thaw frozen lobster tails.  Cut in half lengthwise.  Remove swimmercrettes and sharp edges.  Cut 6 pieces of heavy-duty aluminum foil, 12 x 12-inches each.  Place each lobster tail on foil.  Combine butter, lemon juice and salt.  Baste lobster meat with sauce.  Bring the foil up over the lobster and close all edges with tight double folds.  Make 6 packages.  Place packages on a grill, shell side down, about 5 inches from hot coals.  Cook for 20 minutes.  Remove lobster tails from the foil.  Place lobster tails on grill, flesh side down and cook for 2 to 3 minutes longer or until lightly browned.  Serve with melted butter.  Serves 6.
