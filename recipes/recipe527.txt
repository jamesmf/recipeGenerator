BIRD'S NEST CLUSTERS


12  oz. semi-sweet chocolate pieces
1/2  c. peanut butter
4  c. chow mein noodles
  colored candies

      Place chocolate chips and peanut butter in pan.  Heat until chocolate chips are completely melted.  Add the chow mein noodles. Mix the noodles by using one or two forks or spoons as though you were tossing a salad to get them evenly coated.  Lay a piece of waxed paper over two cookie sheets.  Drop golf ball size clusters on the covered cookie sheets to cool and set.  Add a few colored candies as eggs in the nests.
