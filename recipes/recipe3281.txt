SALSA


1 small  can diced chilies
1 small  can chopped black olives
3  to 4 chopped tomatoes
3  to 4 chopped green onions
3  Tbsp. red wine vinegar
1 1/2  Tbsp. oil
1 1/2  tsp. garlic salt

      Combine all 7 ingredients and refrigerate for 1 hour. Serve with chips.
       Can be spiced up with jalapenos, but as is, it is very mild salsa.
