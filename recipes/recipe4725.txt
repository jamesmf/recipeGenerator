POTATO SOUP
(Microwave)  

3  medium potatoes (1 lb.), peeled and diced
1/2  c. finely chopped onion
1/2  c. water
2  Tbsp. flour
2  c. skim milk
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. black pepper
1  Tbsp. margarine
1  tsp. parsley leaves

      Combine potatoes, onions and water in a 2-quart microwave-safe dish. Cook, covered, on full power, 10 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Stir one time. Lightly mash potatoes. Stir in flour. Add milk, salt and pepper. Cover and cook on full power 5 minutes longer, stirring every minute or until soup boils and is thickened.
       Just before serving, add the tablespoon of margarine and the parsley. Makes 5 servings.
      Tips: Serve with 1/2 tuna salad sandwich on whole wheat toast with lettuce and tomatoes.
