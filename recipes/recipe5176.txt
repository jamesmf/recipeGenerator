CUCUMBER WITH LABAN


2  1/2 cups laban (yogurt)
1  cup cucumbers, peeled and chopped
1/2  tsp. salt
3  cloves garlic
1  tsp. dried or 2 Tbsp. fresh chopped mint

      Mint gives this summer salad a particularly refreshing taste. Break the laban curd with a spoon and stir until smooth. Combine with cucumbers.  Work garlic to a paste with salt and mix it with a spoonful of laban before adding to the cucumber mixture. Add mint.
      Finely shredded lettuce may be substituted for cucumber.
