CASSOULET


1 1/2  lb. beef cubes
1/2  lb. Italian sausage
1 (16 oz.)  can tomatoes
3  Tbsp. Lipton onion soup mix
1/2  c. dry wine (optional)
1 1/2  c. cooked small pasta shells
1 (10 oz.)  pkg. frozen Italian green beans

      Brown beef cubes in small amount of vegetable oil.  At same time, cook sausage for 5 minutes, to remove some fat.  Cut sausage into small pieces and add to beef.  Add can of tomatoes until bubbly.  Pour in wine, cooking to boil off alcohol (about 5 minutes).  Sprinkle soup mix; stir well and cook slowly until meat is tender.  (If using pressure cooker, cook on high for 15 minutes and let cool down.)  Add green beans and let cook for 7 to 8 minutes.  Add cooked shells; mix well.  Cover and let stand before serving; leftovers gain flavor.
