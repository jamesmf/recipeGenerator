MINNESOTA BARS


1  c. white sugar
1  c. white Karo or honey
1 1/2  c. peanut butter
6  c. Special K cereal

      Bring sugar and Karo to a boil (be careful not to scorch).  Mix in peanut butter; stir until smooth.  Pour this mixture over Special K cereal which has been placed in a large bowl.  Mix together and pat it firmly into a 9 x 13-inch pan.  Cover with frosting and cut into squares.
Frosting:
1  pkg. light caramels (about 47 pieces)
6  oz. pkg. chocolate bits
1 to 2  Tbsp. milk

      Melt caramels and chocolate bits in double boiler or microwave; thin with milk to make it easier to spread, if necessary.
