CROCK POT PEPPER ROAST


  big or small jar of roasted pepperoni peppers, depending on size of roast
  chuck or pot roast (one with fat tastes better)
  potatoes (optional)
  carrots (optional)

	Place about 5 or 6 peppers in bottom of pot.  Put roast on top.  Pour remaining peppers and the juice on top.	Cook on low all day while you are at work.  You could also put on before bed and allow to cook all night.  Refrigerate in the morning.
	Note:  If you cut the stems of the peppers, the meat will be spicier.  If concerned about fat, allow pot roast to sit refrigerated for a period until the fat congeals on top and you can remove with a slotted spoon.  If you would like, you can add potatoes and carrots to this.  Get creative.  Be aware that tender veggies like carrots will completely fall apart if cut too small. If you add the potatoes, just half or quarter them.  Salt can be added at the table.
