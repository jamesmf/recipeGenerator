FILLETS DE SOLE, VIN BLANC


4  fillets of sole
1/2  c. lemon juice
1  green onion, chopped fine
1  pinch tarragon (preferably fresh)
1 (10 3/4 oz.)  can condensed mushroom soup
1/2  c. dry Sherry
  butter
  salt
  freshly ground pepper
  grated Parmesan cheese

	Marinate the fillets in lemon juice for at least 15 minutes, then lay them in a buttered flat casserole.  Sprinkle finely chopped onion (or chives) and herbs over the fish.	Mask with mushroom soup diluted with Sherry.	Dot with butter.  Salt and pepper lightly.  Cover the surface with a sprinkling of cheese. Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees;) for 15 to 20 minutes, or until fish is opaque and sauce bubbles and starts to turn a golden brown. Serves 4.	Hot French rolls should be served with the fish to sop up the last drop of sauce.	A dry Chablis, plus a green salad, goes well with this dish.
