HONEY COOKIES


2  eggs
2/3  c. sugar
1/3  c. honey
1  tsp. anise seeds
1/2  tsp. grated orange
1/2  tsp. lemon zest
2 3/4  c. flour
1  tsp. baking powder
1/4  tsp. salt

      In an electric mixer bowl, beat eggs at high speed until very pale and airy, about 3 minutes.  Gradually add sugar and continue beating until the mixture forms a ribbon, about 5 minutes.  Add honey, vanilla, anise seeds, grated orange and lemon zest, beating after each ingredient.  Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt.  Add to the egg mixture and, using a rubber spatula, stir in gently to incorporate.  Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead briefly.  Press dough into floured molds (use your favorite holiday molds).  Lightly tap molds to release imprinted cookie dough.  Transfer to baking sheet.  Position rack in the middle of an oven preheated to 300 degrees;.  Bake until lightly golden and very crisp, approximately 20 minutes.  Transfer to cooling racks and let cool completely.  Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.  Makes about 2 dozen cookies.
