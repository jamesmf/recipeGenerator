SPECIAL SOUP


1  medium celery knob (substitute 3 to 4 stalks celery)
2  small leeks
2  medium onions
  distilled water (to cover vegetables)
1  medium parsley root
  garlic as desired
1 1/2  lb. tomatoes or more
1  lb. potatoes

      Do not peel any of these vegetables; just wash, scrub them well and cut them coarsely.  Simmer them slowly for 2 hours, then put through food mill in small portions; scarcely any fibers should be left.  Vary the amount of water used for cooking according to taste and desired consistency.  Keep well covered in refrigerator, no longer than 2 days; warm up as much as needed each time.
      Note:  For recipes which call for soup stock use the liquid from this Special Soup.
