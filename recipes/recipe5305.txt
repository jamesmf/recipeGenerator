CHICKEN SALAD LETTUCE WRAPS
(Easy Appetizer)  

1/4  c. slivered almonds, chopped
1  c. chicken salad
1/4  c. dried cranberries
6  butterhead lettuce leaves

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;. Bake almonds for 5 to 7 minutes or until toasted. In a small bowl, stir chicken salad, cranberries and almonds together. If necessary, cut the bottom of each butterhead leaf, making leaves about 6-inches long. Discard bottom of leaves. Spread about 3 tablespoons of mixture lengthwise down one edge of each butterhead leaf. Roll up and secure each with 3 wooden cocktail picks, completely enclosing salad in lettuce. Use a gentle sawing motion to cut each lettuce roll between the picks, making 3 pieces.
