RED FRUIT JELLY WITH CREAM
(Rodgrod Med Flode)  

1  lb. red currants
1/2  lb. cherries or raspberries
1/2  lb. black currants or make use of all the fruits of the season
5 to 6  Tbsp. sugar
  about 1 1/2 pt. water
2 1/2 to 3  Tbsp. cornstarch per 1 pt. liquid

      Wash the berries (there is no need to remove the stalks). Place in layers in an enamel saucepan, adding just enough water to cover.  Bring slowly to the boil and simmer until the fruit has all broken up and the juice is dark red in color.
      Sieve the juice through a clean, scalded piece of linen or cheesecloth, pressing as much juice out of the berries as possible. Measure the juice, boil up and dissolve in a little cold water.
      Pour into a bowl.  Sprinkle with sugar to prevent a skin forming and serve cold with milk or cream.
