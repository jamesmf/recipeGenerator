BLACK FOREST TRIFLE


4 1/2  c. milk, divided
3  sq. unsweetened chocolate
1/3  c. cornstarch
1/2  c. sugar
1/4  tsp. salt
2  tsp. vanilla extract
2  c. cookie crumbs
1 (20 oz.)  can cherry pie filling

      In a large saucepan, slowly heat 4 cups milk with the chocolate just until bubbles form around edge of pan.  In a small bowl, combine cornstarch, sugar, salt and remaining milk; mix well. Gradually stir cornstarch mixture into hot milk; bring to boiling, stirring.  Boil 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat. Add vanilla.  Spoon one-third of the chocolate pudding into a 2-quart bowl or souffle dish.  Top with one-third of the crumbs. Set aside 1/2 cup cherry filling.  Gently spoon half of remaining cherry filling onto crumbs.
      Repeat layering with another third of chocolate pudding, crumbs, the remaining cherry filling and remaining pudding.  Spoon reserved 1/2 cup cherry filling in center of chocolate pudding layer.  Spoon remaining crumbs to form a border around cherry filling.  Refrigerate covered until well chilled, 5 to 6 hours.
