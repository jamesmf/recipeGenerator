PASTA SOUP


3  or 4 chicken breasts
  olive oil
3 (14 oz.)  cans fat-free chicken broth (Italian herbs)
8  baby carrots, sliced
1  cayenne pepper
1  pkg. fresh pasta with stuffing (I use Buitoni Mozzarella and herb tortelloni)
1 1/2  c. cabbage (large pieces)
1 1/2  c. fresh baby spinach leaves
1 (5 oz.)  can evaporated milk
1  Tbsp. cornstarch
  salt and pepper to taste

	Cut the chicken tenders into quarter size pieces. Cook for a few minutes in a bit of olive oil. Do not completely cook them. Put the chicken tenders aside. Pour the three cans of chicken broth into a large pot.
	Slice the carrots and cayenne pepper and add to broth. When the broth comes to a boil, add the tortelloni. When the tortelloni is almost done, add the chicken tenders. Wait a minute or so and then add the cabbage, followed by the spinach a minute or so later.
	 Mix the can of milk with the cornstarch and add to the broth to thicken the soup and make it creamy. Add salt and pepper to taste.
	Optional: Can be served with hot blueberry muffins or some good whole wheat bread.
