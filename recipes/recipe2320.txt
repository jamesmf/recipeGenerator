GRILLED ITALIAN TOMATOES


3  large firm ripe tomatoes
2  Tbsp. commercial Italian dressing
1 1/2  tsp. basil
  salt and pepper to taste
1/4  c. melted butter or margarine
1  c. breadcrumbs

      Cut tomatoes in half crosswise and sprinkle each half with 1 teaspoon Italian dressing, 1/4 teaspoon basil, salt and pepper. Combine butter and breadcrumbs; spoon over tomato halves.
      Place tomato halves on heavy-duty aluminum foil.  Seal foil, leaving a small amount of space for steam to escape.  Cook over hot coals for 10 minutes.  Yields 6 servings.
