BANANA PUDDING



4  eggs
2  c. sugar
2  c. milk
1  tsp. vanilla extract
2  tsp. cornstarch
6  bananas
1  pkg. vanilla wafers

      Put eggs in a boiler and beat well.  Add sugar; mix well.  Add milk.  Cook slow until it gets to a boil, then add vanilla extract, then cornstarch (mixed in a little milk just to make a paste).  Add to the pudding.  This will thicken and will be ready to finish. Cut the bananas, put in bowl and add 1 layer of wafers.  Add some pudding mix.  Continue until all is finished.
