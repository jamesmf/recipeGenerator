CHICKEN PICCATA


1  lemon
1/3  c. all-purpose flour
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. freshly ground black pepper
4 chicken breasts (1 lb. total),  pound to thin slices
2  tsp. olive oil
1  clove garlic, minced
1/2  c. reduced-sodium or regular chicken broth
1  Tbsp. capers, rinsed
1/2  tsp. sugar
2  tsp. butter
1  Tbsp. chopped fresh parsley

      With a sharp knife, remove skin and white pith from lemon and discard.  Working over a bowl, cut lemon segments from their surrounding membranes.  Chop segments coarsely and reserve with the juice.
      In a shallow dish, combine flour, salt and pepper. Lightly dredge chicken in flour mixture, shaking off excess. In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown on the outside, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter and keep warm.
      Add garlic to the skillet and cook, stirring for several seconds.  Add chicken broth and bring to a boil, stirring and scraping up any browned bits.  Cook for 1 minute.  Stir in reserved lemon segments and juice, capers and sugar; cook for 30 seconds. Add butter.  Spoon sauce over chicken; sprinkle with parsley and pepper.  Serve immediately.  Serve with angel hair pasta, salad and fresh baked bread.  Makes 4 servings.
