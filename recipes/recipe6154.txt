BAKED POTATO SOUP


1/4  c. butter
1/4  c. flour
3  c. milk
  salt and pepper, to taste
3  large potatoes, baked
4  oz. sour cream
  green onions, chopped
  bacon, cooked crisp, crumbled
  cheddar cheese, grated

      Melt butter in a medium size saucepan over medium heat. Using a wire whisk, slowly blend in flour until thoroughly blended.  Gradually add milk, whisking constantly.  Whisk in salt and pepper and simmer over low heat, stirring constantly.  Cut potatoes in half, scoop out the meat and set aside.  Add potatoes to milk mixture.  Add sour cream and simmer, stirring to keep soup from sticking.  Garnish with grated cheddar cheese, bacon and green onions.
