CHICKEN BREASTS WITH ADOBADO SAUCE


12  ancho chilies
1/2  c. vinegar
2  onions
1  Tbsp. garlic, pureed
2  Tbsp. cumin
4  c. chicken stock, canned or preferably homemade
1/4  c. brown sugar
1/4  c. orange juice
1/8  c. lemon or lime juice
1/4 to 1/2  c. tomato puree (no salt added)
6  medium-sized chicken breasts

      Remove the seeds from the chilies and lightly roast to develop the full flavor.  Soak in the vinegar (add enough water to cover) for 15 minutes, then puree.  Brown the onions, then add the garlic puree and cumin.  Add the chili puree and stock.  Let cook for about 20 minutes or until the flavors have all merged.
      Make a paste of the brown sugar, orange juice, lemon or lime juice and tomato puree.  Whip into the sauce and continue cooking another 15 minutes.  Taste and adjust seasoning.  Marinate the chicken breasts in the sauce 2 to 3 hours.  Grill over charcoal or bake in 400 degrees; oven for 20 to 25 minutes.  To broil, allow about 8 minutes a side.  This sauce is also an excellent marinade for pork chops or ribs.  Serves 6. Contains 275 calories per serving.
