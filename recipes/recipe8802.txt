"SOUPER" OVEN POT ROAST


1  pkg. dried onion soup mix
1 (10 3/4 oz.)  can cream of mushroom soup
3 to 4  lb. beef roast (chuck or rump)

      Heat oven to 325 degrees;.  Mix together 2 soups.  Place beef on heavy foil and pour soup over and around meat.  Bring long sides of foil together and fold over in a secure fold.  Pull up short ends of foil; fold securely to keep in steam.  Place on baking sheet or shallow pan.  Roast approximately 4 hours.  Test for doneness during last 1/2 hour.  Meat is extremely tender.
      Note:  If fat is well trimmed prior to roasting, soups and pan juices make a wonderful ready-made gravy.
