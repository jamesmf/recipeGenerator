CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE BOMBE WITH HAZELNUTS


1  qt. fine quality chocolate ice cream
2/3  c. heavy cream
6  oz. bittersweet or semi-sweet chocolate
1/4  c. praline or Frangelico liqueur
1/4  c. coarsely chopped toasted hazelnuts (filberts)
1  Tbsp. Grand Marnier
  chocolate curls (optional)

      Line bottom of 5-cup ring mold with 3/4 of the ice cream.  With small spoon, push ice cream up sides of mold, leaving deep groove in center.  Freeze until firm.  Bring cream to boil; remove from heat.  Add chocolate and stir until melted.  Blend in liqueur, hazelnuts and Grand Marnier.  Cool truffle mixture to room temperature.  Pour truffle mixture into groove of mold.  Spread remaining ice cream on top; cover with foil and freeze at least 4 hours.
      This can be prepared several days ahead, wrapped and kept in freezer.
      Unmold, smooth outside surface and let stand a few minutes to soften slightly; garnish with chocolate curls, if desired.  Slice and serve.  Yields 8 servings.
