CHOCOLATE BROWNIE PIE


3  sq. baking chocolate
3  eggs
1/3  c. butter or margarine
1 1/2  c. granulated sugar
3/4  c. all-purpose flour, sifted
1/2  tsp. salt
1/3  c. milk
1  tsp. vanilla
1  c. chopped nuts

      Melt baking chocolate and let stand to cool.  Beat eggs until very light.  Cream butter.  Gradually add sugar to the butter, beating until light and fluffy.  Sift flour and salt together; set aside.  Add the cooled chocolate and the eggs to the creamed mixture.  Mix well.  Alternately add flour mixture and milk (to which the vanilla has been added).  Stir in nuts.  Pour into a greased 9-inch pie pan.  Bake at 375 degrees; for 45 to 50 minutes.  Serve with ice cream, if desired.
