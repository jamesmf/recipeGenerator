CHICKEN AND ESCAROLE SOUP


1  lb. hamburger
2  slices bread (wet), broken up
2  eggs
1 1/2  c. grated Cheddar cheese
1/2  c. Parmesan cheese
  salt to taste
  oregano to taste

      Boil 1 chicken or stewing hen.  Squeeze 1/2 lemon into stock. Use 2 or 3 cubes chicken bouillon or 2 tablespoons chicken soup base.  Boil with celery, onion and garlic.  Remove chicken and pick meat off bones.  Return meat to stock.  The fat needs to be skimmed off.  (It's easier to refrigerate and then skim off and re-cook the next day.)  Heat stock.  Add meatballs and cook about 2 hours. Just before serving, add one bunch escarole (spinach), chopped up. Heat and serve.
