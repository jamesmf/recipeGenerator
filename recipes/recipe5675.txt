FROZEN FRUIT SALAD


1 large  can fruit cocktail, drained
1/4  c. sugar
2  Tbsp. cornstarch
  cherry juice (enough to make pink/red color)

	Drain can fruit cocktail into small bowl.
	 In a saucepan, combine the sugar and cornstarch with the juice and mix well. Cook on medium heat, stirring constantly, until juice mixture turns clear glazed color. Let cool.
	When cool, add enough cherry juice to make a nice pink-red color. Mix with fruit and pour into muffin pans and freeze until firm (about 3 hours).
	Serve with sandwiches, meat or anything calling for  good salad. (Keeps in the freezer for a very long time - weeks.)
