Tofu

Types of Tofu:

    Three main types of tofu are available in American grocery stores.
      Firm Tofu is dense and solid and holds up well in stir-fry dishes, soups or on the grill, anywhere that you want the tofu to maintain its shape.  Firm tofu is higher in protein, fat and calcium than other forms of tofu.
      Soft Tofu is a good choice for recipes that call for blended tofu or in Oriental soups.
      Silken Tofu is made by a slightly different process.  This results in a creamy, custard-like product.  Silken tofu forks well in pureed or blended dishes.  In Japan, silken tofu is enjoyed as is, with a touch of soy sauce and topped with chopped scallions.
