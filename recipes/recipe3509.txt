TABOULEH
(Green Arabic Salad)  

3  oz. (25-75 g) fine burgul (cracked wheat)
4  oz. (100 g) parsley, finely chopped
5  Tbsp. mint, finely chopped
5  Tbsp. spring onions, finely chopped
3  tomatoes, seeded and finely chopped
4  Tbsp. olive oil
3  Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
1  tsp. salt
8  leaves romaine lettuce

      Soak the burgul in water for 15-20 minutes or until softened but a little resistant to the bite.  Drain and squeeze out excess moisture.
      Add the burgul to the onions, parsley and mint.
      Mix the salt, lemon juice and olive oil.  Toss into the salad and leave to stand for 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to absorb. Add chopped tomatoes and adjust seasoning to taste by adding more salt, olive oil or lemon juice.  Toss salad.
      Place tabouleh on lettuce leaves and garnish with a sprig of mint to serve.
