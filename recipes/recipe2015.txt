ORANGE BRITTLE


1  large orange
1  c. sugar
1/2  c. light corn syrup
1/2  tsp. salt
2  Tbsp. butter or margarine, softened
1  tsp. baking soda

      Grease large cookie sheet.  Grate peel from orange; set peel aside.  Squeeze 1/4 cup juice from orange.  In heavy 2-quart saucepan with candy thermometer in place over medium heat, heat orange juice, sugar, corn syrup and salt until boiling and sugar is dissolved, stirring occasionally.  Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until temperature reaches 300 degrees; or hard-crack stage (when a small amount of mixture dropped into very cold water separates into hard and brittle threads).  Remove saucepan from heat; immediately stir in reserved orange peel, butter or margarine and baking soda.  Pour at once onto cookie sheet.  With 2 forks, lift and pull mixture into rectangle about 14 x 12-inches.  Cool. Can be considered low protein.
