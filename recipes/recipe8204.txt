SELF-CRUSTED CHICKEN POT PIE


3 to 4  lb. chicken, boiled and deboned
3  boiled eggs
1  can cream of chicken soup
1 1/2  c. chicken broth
1  can mixed vegetables, cooked and seasoned to taste, then drained (optional)

 
Crust:
1  stick butter, melted
1  c. milk
1  c. self-rising flour
1/4  tsp. pepper

      Place boiled and deboned chicken that has been cut up into bite sizes into casserole dish that has been greased. If you want the vegetables in your pot pie, spread evenly on top  of chicken. Slice boiled eggs and place on top of vegetables. Mix soup and broth together well, then pour over pot pie; do not stir.
       Crust:  Melt butter, then mix other ingredients into the butter; pour over pot pie and spread gently and evenly on top. DO NOT STIR!  This makes the crust. Cook at 400 degrees; until golden brown, around 30 minutes.
