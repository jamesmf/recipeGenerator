1  chicken breast per person
  flour
  olive oil
  onion, chopped fine
  Italian parsley, chopped fine
  basil, chopped fine
  rosemary, chopped fine
  garlic, chopped fine
2  c. chicken broth
  salt and pepper, to taste
8  oz. fresh mushrooms, cut up
  cooked linguine
  parmesan cheese

      Dust chicken lightly with flour, saut√© in olive oil until browned slightly on each side.  Dump onion, parsley, basil, rosemary, and garlic onto chicken.  Pour chicken broth on the spiced chicken.  May need to use more or less, depending on how much chicken you cook.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Simmer on the lowest heat possible for 1 1/2 hours.  One half hour before serving, pour mushrooms in pan. Simmer 1/2 hour more.  Serve hot over linguine, topped with parmesan cheese.
      Note:  Be very generous with the fresh herbs.  When you think you have too much cut up, it may not be enough.  Can substitute veal shanks for chicken.
