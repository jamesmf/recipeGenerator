MAKE AHEAD STUFFED CABBAGE ROLLS

Cabbage Rolls:
1 1/2  lb. ground beef, uncooked
2  c. cooked rice
1  c. chopped onion
1  tsp. chili powder
1  tsp. garlic salt
1  tsp. salt

      Combine beef, rice, onion, chili powder and salt.  Mix well. Divide into 8 equal portions.  Cut the stiff ridge from the back of each cabbage leaf.  Cook leaves in boiling water, 2 at a time, just until they are limp; drain well.  Place one portion of the meat mixture at stem end of each cabbage leaf and roll up, folding the sides of the leaves over meat mixture.  Arrange rolls in plastic container with fitted lid.  Seal and freeze.  When ready to use, arrange frozen cabbage rolls in large frying pan.

1  can (15 oz.) tomato sauce
1  c. fresh onion (diced or sliced)
2  Tbsp. brown sugar
1  Tbsp. vinegar

      Mix all together and pour over cabbage rolls.  Heat to simmering stage.  Cover pan and cook slowly until rolls are done, about 45 minutes.  Makes 8 servings.
