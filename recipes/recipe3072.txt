STUFFED MUSHROOMS


2  pkg. mushrooms
8  oz. cream cheese

      Wash mushrooms and remove stems; let dry. Mix cream cheese, Beau Monde (a spice mix) and bacon bits together. Use a table knife to "stuff" cream cheese into mushrooms. Bake on an ungreased cookie pan at 350 degrees; until cream cheese is lightly browned on top. Cool a moment before eating.
