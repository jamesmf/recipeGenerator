CINNAMON SPICED PECANS


1  large egg white (2 Tbsp.)
1  tsp. water
1/2  c. sugar
1  tsp. kosher salt
1/2  tsp. ground cinnamon
4  c. raw pecan halves

      Preheat oven to 250 degrees;.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Place the egg white in a large stainless steel bowl and whisk until frothy.  Slowly whisk in the water, sugar, salt and cinnamon until thick.  Fold in the pecans and toss until well coated.  Transfer pecans to prepared baking sheet and arrange in a single layer.  Place in the oven and bake, stirring every 15 minutes, until the meringue covers the nuts with a chewy, pale golden brown coating, 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let sit 5 minutes; then remove the nuts from the pan with a metal spatula and set aside to cool before serving.  Makes 4 cups.
