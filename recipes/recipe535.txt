BASEBALL MITT


1 (4 serving size)  pkg. instant pudding (any flavor)
2  c. milk
1 (4 oz.)  pkg. single serve graham crust
1 1/2  c. frozen nondairy whipped topping, thawed
12  Vienna finger sandwich cookies
1  tube red decorating gel

      Prepare pudding with milk as directed on package.  Spoon into crust.  Spoon whipped topping over pudding and edge of crust to cover, mounding it to resemble a ball and smoothing the surface. Break cookies in half.  Tuck 3 broken halves into pudding, slightly overlapping around upper edge of crust.  Put another half cookie slightly to the left of other fingers for thumb.  Draw 2 half circles and stitching on ball with gel.
