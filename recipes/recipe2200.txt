WATER-BATH METHOD FOR PICKLING AND CANNING


1  large kettle or stockpot with lid
1  rack that will fit the bottom of the kettle
1  jar lifter
1  ladle

      Begin by making sure that the pot or kettle you are using is deep enough that you can place the canning jars inside it and cover them with at least 1-inch of water.
      Examine the canning jars you are going to use to make sure that there are no nicks, cracks or sharp edges on the sealing surface.
      Wash all jars in hot soapy water or run them through the dishwasher.
      Cover clean jars with hot water and leave them in hot water until ready to use.
      Pour or pack ingredients to be canned into jars, leaving 1/4-inch space at the top.
      Wipe the rims of the jars clean and put on two-piece canning lids.  Tighten the screw bands thoroughly.
      Put the jars on a rack in kettle half full of boiling water. Be sure to leave room between the jars for water to circulate.  Add boiling water to cover jars by 1 to 2-inches.
      Cover the pot and bring it to a hard boil.  Reduce the heat to hold the water at a steady but gentle boil and continue to boil for 15 minutes.  Remove the jars from the boiling water with a jar lifter.  Place jars on a dishtowel or other fabric.  DO NOT place jars on a cool surface as this may cause them to break and possibly cause injury.  Allow jars to cool completely, then store them in a cool dark place.
