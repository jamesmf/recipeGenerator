ELEGANT POTATO SALAD


6  cups, cooked, diced potatoes (7 medium size)
3/4  c. sour cream
3/4  c. Miracle Whip (do not use mayonnaise)
3/4  c. diced green pepper
3/4  c. sliced celery
1/2  c. onion, chopped fine
1  Tbsp. celery seed
1  tsp. garlic salt
1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. pepper

      Cool potatoes completely.  Mix sour cream and Miracle Whip together; add all other ingredients together and mix well.  Pour this mixture over cooled potatoes and mix well.  Flavor mixes best if chilled at least 3 to 4 hours before serving.  This salad keeps well in refrigerator.
