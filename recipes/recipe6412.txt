PINEAPPLE SALAD


1  (8 oz.) plain yogurt (lemon or vanilla yogurt are O.K. too)
1 small  box instant vanilla pudding or lemon
1 large  can crushed pineapple
1  container whipped topping

      Mix the yogurt and pudding together in a large bowl. Add the can of pineapple (do NOT drain it) to the yogurt/pudding mixture and stir. Fold the whipped topping (Cool Whip) to the mixture. Chill for 1 hour.
      I use this topping on angel food cake - YUM!! It tastes great with fat-free or reduced-fat products also!
