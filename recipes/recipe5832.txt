CRANBERRY SAUCE


1  bell pepper
1/2  c. vinegar
3  c. cranberries
1  c. water
2 1/2  c. sugar
1  1/2 jalapeno peppers (adjust according to taste and do not remove seeds, only stem)

      Core and seed bell peppers; cut into cubes and put in blender to combine with sugar and vinegar. With blender running, drop in jalapeno pepper and process until pureed. Add cranberries and combine. Transfer to a large saucepan. Add water. Bring to a boil and cook over a medium heat until mixture thickens. Pour into jars. Spread cream cheese on crackers. Add a spoon of the sauce. This will keep indefinitely if sealed and stored properly.
