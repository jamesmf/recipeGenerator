STEW THE OLD FASHIONED WAY


1  pkg. beef stew meat
  Flour, salt and pepper
  Cooking oil for browning meat
2  cans stewed tomatoes
  1-2 bay leaves
  3-4 large potatoes
  6-8 medium carrots
1  pkg. small corn on the cob

      In a Ziploc type bag, put flour and desired salt and pepper. You will want enough to shake all your stew meat.  Shake 4-5 pieces at a time and brown in skillet with hot oil.  In your stew pot (or Dutch oven) mix the onion and tomatoes, add the browned meat and bay leaves.  Simmer on low for at least one hour stirring occasionally.  If it sticks to the bottom, the heat is too high. Chop potatoes and carrots to desired sizes and add to mixture. Cut the corn on the cob pieces in half (making 1/4 size cobs) and add to mixture.  Simmer until potatoes and carrots are done.
