RUMAKI
(Do Ahead)  

1 (8 oz.)  can water chestnuts
1  lb. chicken livers, halved
12  to 14 bacon slices, cut in thirds
4  Tbsp. brown sugar
4  Tbsp. soy sauce

      Dip liver halves in brown sugar.  Slice water chestnuts in halves.  Hold each piece of liver and chestnut; wrap around with bacon slice.  Secure both ends with toothpick.  If you are not ready to use them, refrigerate up to 1 day.  When ready to cook, place on broiler pan and broil each side until bacon is crisp (15 minutes).  Can prepare 1 day in advance, but cook at last minute. Serves 8.
