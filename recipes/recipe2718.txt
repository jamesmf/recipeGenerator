PASKA


1  Tbsp. sugar
1  c. lukewarm water
3  pkg. dry yeast
3  c. scalded milk (lukewarm)
2  c. light raisins
12  c. flour
6  eggs, beaten
1 1/2  c. sugar
1/2  lb. melted butter (1 c.)
3  tsp. salt

      Dissolve sugar in lukewarm water and add yeast; let stand for 10 minutes.  Add lukewarm milk and 4 1/2 cups flour.  Mix until smooth; let rise until bubbly.  Add eggs, raisins, sugar, butter and salt; mix thoroughly.  Add enough flour to make a dough that does not stick to your hand.  Knead until shining.  Let rise until double in size.  Punch down and let rise again.  Divide and round dough into 3 balls, 1 for each loaf (medium-sized).  Place in greased round pans to double in size.  Brush with a beaten egg, mixed with 2 tablespoons water.  Bake at 350 degrees; for 15 minutes, then at 325 degrees; for 35 minutes.
