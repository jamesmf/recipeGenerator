SPINACH DIP


1  small block frozen chopped spinach
1  large tomato, diced
1  small white onion, diced
1  (8 oz.) block cream cheese, cubed
1  (12 oz.) bag shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 to 1 1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. pepper
1/2 small  jar sliced jalapeno peppers (no juice)*

      *Half of a jar of peppers makes the dip spicy. You might need to adjust the amount to your liking.
      Preheat oven to 350 degrees;. Thaw spinach and drain the juice. Dice up the onion and tomato. In a 9 x 9 ovensafe dish, combine the spinach, onion, tomato, cubed cream cheese, shredded cheese, salt, pepper and jalapeno peppers. Stir. Cook, uncovered, for 30 to 40 minutes. Stir halfway through cooking. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes to thicken. Serve on Triscuits, crackers, tortilla chips or bread bowl.
