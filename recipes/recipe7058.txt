BARBECUED SAGE SPARERIBS


6  lb. country-style pork spareribs
1  medium onion, chopped
2  to 3 garlic cloves, minced
2  Tbsp. mixed pickling spices
1  Tbsp. fresh minced sage or 1 tsp. rubbed sage
1/2  tsp. hot pepper sauce
18  oz. barbecue sauce

      Place ribs in a Dutch oven and cover with water. Add onion, garlic, pickling spices, sage and hot pepper sauce. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 90 minutes or until tender. Cool slightly. Rinse ribs with water to remove spices. Pour barbecue sauce into a large resealable plastic bag or shallow baking dish. Add ribs; cover and refrigerate overnight. Bring to room temperature. Drain, reserving marinade. Grill ribs, uncovered, over medium heat, turning several times until browned and heated through, about 10 minutes. Place marinade in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Brush over the ribs.
