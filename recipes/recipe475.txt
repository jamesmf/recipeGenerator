      Dissolve yeast in water until foamy.  Combine all ingredients. Knead until dough no longer clings to hands (adding small amounts of flour to dough if needed); let dough rest 15 minutes, then shape into bagels.  Let them rise for 30 minutes, then drop gently into a large pot of boiling sugar water.  Flip the bagels in the water (still simmering) after 3 minutes.  Cook other sides 3 minutes as well.  Remove from pot, then bake on ungreased cookie sheet for 30 to 35 minutes at 375 degrees;.
