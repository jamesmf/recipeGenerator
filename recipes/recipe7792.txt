POACHED SALMON IN TOMATO BROTH


4  medium tomatoes
1/4  c. (60 ml) white wine or chicken stock
2  Tbsp. (30 ml) butter
1  tsp. (5 ml) fennel seeds
4  to 6 salmon fillets or steaks (about 4 oz., 120 g each)
1/2  c. (125 ml) chopped fresh basil
  salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

      Peel and seed tomatoes*. Puree the tomatoes in an electric blender or food processor. Combine the pureed tomatoes, wine or broth, butter and fennel seeds in a large skillet over moderate heat. Place salmon fillets on top and sprinkle with the chopped basil. Season with salt and pepper and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Serves 4 to 6.
      *To Peel and Seed Tomatoes: Make a small x-shaped incision in the bottom of the tomato using a sharp paring knife. Plunge the tomatoes into boiling water for 10 seconds. Rinse under cold water to stop the cooking. The peel should slide off easily. Cut the tomatoes in half and squeeze the seeds out using your fingers or a small spoon to scoop them out if necessary.
