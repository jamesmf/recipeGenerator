PASTA SALAD PARMESAN


2  c. vegetable-flavored macaroni twists (uncooked)
1 1/2  c. broccoli flowerets
1/2  c. chopped green pepper
1/2  c. chopped celery
1/4  c. chopped parsley
1 1/2  c. cherry tomato halves
1  c. diced cooked chicken breast

 
Herb Dressing:
1/4  c. olive oil
3  Tbsp. wine vinegar
1  Tbsp. lemon juice
1  Tbsp. chopped fresh basil or 1 tsp. dried, crushed
2  tsp. sugar
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. black pepper
  several dashes bottled hot pepper sauce (optional)
3  Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese

      Combine Herb Dressing ingredients. Stir well and reserve.
      Cook pasta twists according to package directions. Drain, rinse with cool water and drain again. Place in a 2-quart bowl.
      Cook broccoli, covered, 1 1/2 minutes in microwave oven or until crispy-tender. Leave the broccoli uncooked, if you prefer. Add vegetables and chicken to pasta. Stir dressing well and pour over all. Toss. Chill. Toss again and sprinkle Parmesan over top just before serving. Makes 6 servings, approximately 1 cup each.
Tips:

      Serve with fresh fruit and crusty bread or toast.
      You may use tuna, turkey or lean ham instead of the chicken.
