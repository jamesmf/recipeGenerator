REUBEN SANDWICHES


12  oz. thinly sliced canned or fully cooked corned beef
8  slices light or dark Rye bread
1  can (8 oz.) sauerkraut, drained
1/2  c. thousand island dressing
4  slices Swiss cheese

      Arrange corned beef on 4 slices of bread.  Top each with a quarter of the sauerkraut, 2 Tbsp. of dressing and a slice of cheese.  Top with remaining bread.  In a skillet over medium heat, melt 2 to 3 Tbsp. butter.  Toast sandwiches until bread is lightly browned on one side.  Turn sandwiches and brown other side, adding more butter if necessary.  Cook until cheese is melted and meat is heated through.  Yield: 4 sandwiches.  Delicious!
