TACO TATER SKINS


6  large russet potatoes
1/2  c. butter or margarine, melted
2  Tbsp. taco seasoning
1  c. (4 oz.) shredded cheddar cheese
15  bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
3  green onions, chopped
  salsa and/or sour cream, optional

      Bake potatoes at 375 degrees; for 1 hour or until tender.  Reduce heat to 350 degrees;.  When potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut lengthwise into quarters.  Scoop out pulp, leaving a 1/4 inch shell.  (Save pulp for another use.)   Combine the butter and taco seasoning; brush over both sides of potato skins.  Place skin side down on a greased baking sheet.  Sprinkle with cheese, crumbled bacon and green onions.  Return to oven and bake until cheese is melted, and lightly browned.  Serve with salsa and sour cream, if desired.
