SIRNAYA PASKHA
(Cheese Cake)  

2  lb. dry unsalted cottage cheese
1  lb. sweet butter
2  c. sugar
3  egg yolks
1  Tbsp. vanilla
1 1/2  c. whipped cream
1/2  c. slivered almonds (optional)
1/2  c. glazed fruit, chopped fine (optional)

      Put cheese through a fine food chopper or sieve at least 2 times and set aside.  Cream butter and sugar until almost white. Add egg yolks and continue creaming.  Add vanilla.  When this mixture is thoroughly blended, add the cheese and mix well.  Add the whipped cream.  Additions of almonds and fruit is optional and added last.  Put the mixture in a cheesecloth lined clay flowerpot, colander or paskha mold.  Put a heavy weight on the top to help press out the excess moisture.  Put container on wire rack so that the cheese will not sit in the drained liquid.  Let drain at least 24 hours.  Chill thoroughly.  This freezes beautifully.  Unmold and remove cheesecloth before serving.  Decorate with bits of candied fruit.
