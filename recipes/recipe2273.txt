CHICKEN FINGER SNACKS


1/2  c. honey
1/4  c. Dijon mustard
4  (4 oz.) skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1  c. all-purpose flour
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
3/4  c. milk
1  c. vegetable oil for frying

      Make 1 to 2 days ahead of time the honey mustard dip so it has time to let the flavors blend.  You do this by mixing honey and mustard together well and store in airtight container. Refrigerate.
      Cut chicken into 1/2 x 2-inch strips.  Set aside.  Mix flour, salt and pepper in shallow bowl.  Dip chicken in milk.  Roll in flour mixture to coat well.  Place breaded chicken on wax paper. Heat 1/4-inch of oil in large heavy skillet.  Heat to about 350 degrees;. You can tell it's hot enough by dropping a cube of bread in and it browns in 1 minute.  Add chicken to oil; fry, turning 1 time, about 3 minutes each side.  Drain and serve with sauce.
