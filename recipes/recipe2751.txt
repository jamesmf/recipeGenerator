1  small head cauliflower, separated into florets
4  small green peppers, quartered
2  medium zucchini, cut into 8 pieces
  crushed dried basil, to taste
  Open Pit barbecue sauce

      Thread vegetables on 6-inch long skewers, placing 2 pieces of each vegetable on each 6-inch skewer.  Brush with barbecue sauce and sprinkle with crushed basil.  Place on broiler tray in range.
