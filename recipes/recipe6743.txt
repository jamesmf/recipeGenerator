Cover with 1/2 pound grated Cheddar or Velveeta cheese.  Then add remaining bread cubes, milk, beaten eggs, salt, dry mustard and onion.  Pour over bread.  Either store in refrigerator overnight or let stand for 2 hours before baking. If refrigerated, let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before putting in the oven.  Set casserole in a pan of hot water for baking.  Bake 1 hour at 350 degrees;.  Before baking, test pudding.  If too dry, add a bit more milk (usually not necessary).  Be sure the cheese will melt well.  If in doubt, use Velveeta.
