BAINGAN CHAMP

Meat:
2  lb. T-bone chops
1  Tbsp. each, ginger/garlic paste
2  tsp. green chili paste
1  tsp. cumin powder
  Salt to taste
1  cup water
  Bread crumbs
2  eggs beaten with salt, pepper and pinch of cayenne

 
Potatoes:
1-1/2  tsp. salt
  3-4 boiled potatoes, mashed
1  can pure cream
1/8  tsp. cinnamon powder
1/8  tsp. mustard powder
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper

 
Chutney:
1  bunch cilantro
2  cloves garlic
2  Tbsp. desiccated coconut
1  tsp. sesame seeds
2  small green chilies
1/2  tsp. cumin powder
1/4  cup lemon juice

      Combine all the `Potato' ingredients and set aside.  Blend together all the chutney ingredients and set aside.
      Slit the meat near the tip of the bone and pull the meat all the way back to make a T shape.  Add ginger/garlic paste, cumin powder, and salt to the meat.  Add 1 cup water and let it boil until meat is tender and most of the water has dried up.  Let it cool a bit.
      Take a large quantity of potato and shape into a big ball. Flatten out on a piece of wax paper.  There must be enough potato to envelope one T-bone chop.  Now take one T-bone chop and dip both sides generously in the chutney.  Place the chop carefully on the flattened potato and fold over the sides to fit snugly over the chop (leaving out the handle).  Make sure that the potato is tightly and smoothly wrapped around the meat.  Proceed to cover the remaining chops using the same method.
      Carefully pick up the potato-coated chops and coat both sides with breadcrumbs then the beaten egg.  Pan-fry in hot oil, turning a couple times, until nicely browned.  The fried chops will resemble the shape of small baingans (eggplants).
