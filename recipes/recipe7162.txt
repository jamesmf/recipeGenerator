SESAME CHICKEN


3  tbsp light soy sauce
1  tbsp white cooking wine
3  cloves garlic (pushed through a press or finely chopped)
1  tsp sugar
1  1/2 lbs boneless chicken breast (cut into 1 inch pieces)
2  or 3 tbsp sesame seeds
  rice
  parsley, onion and butter - (small amounts)

      Mix the first 4 ingredients together to make marinade.  Put chicken pieces in the marinade and marinate at least 1/2 hour (it's best to make marinade in the morning - cover the dish and refrigerate until dinner for best flavor).
      When your ready to cook, in a dry pan, toast the sesame seeds until light brown (watch closely they burn easily).  Cook rice and keep it aside (I cheat and use the kind you boil in a bag).  Put 2 tbsp butter in frying pan - saut√© a small amount of parsley and onion in butter.  Add rice and stir to coat.  Stir fry chicken pieces and serve over rice.  Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.
