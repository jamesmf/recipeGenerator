MACARONI "N" CHEESE PIZZA


8  oz. uncooked elbow macaroni
3  eggs
1  c. shredded Cheddar cheese
1  lb. ground beef
3/4  c. chopped onion
1 (15 oz.)  can pizza sauce
1 (4 oz.)  can mushroom stems, drained
  pepperoni slices
1  c. shredded Mexican cheese blend

	Cook macaroni according to package directions; drain. In a bowl, beat the eggs; stir in Cheddar cheese and macaroni. Spread onto a 14-inch pizza pan. Bake at 375 degrees; for 15 minutes.
	Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is well done; drain. Add pizza sauce and mix well. Spread over macaroni crust. Sprinkle with mushrooms, pepperoni and Mexican cheese. Bake for 15 to 20 more minutes or until cheese is melted. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing.
	(NOTE)	I like to use 2 cups of Mexican cheese for more cheesy taste.
