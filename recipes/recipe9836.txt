AU GRATIN POTATOES


4  large white potatoes
5  Tbsp. flour
  salt to taste
  pepper to taste
3  c. milk
1/4  c. butter
1  lb. Cheddar cheese

      Peel and slice potatoes in a large bowl.  Salt and pepper. Combine 2 tablespoons of flour with milk.  Mix well until flour dissolves.  Pour over potatoes; let potatoes soak in milk and seasoning while grating cheese.  In a greased 2-quart casserole, put a layer of potatoes and dot with butter.  Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon flour; cover with cheese.  Repeat layers, ending with 3 layers of potatoes and cheese.  Stir seasoned milk and pour over casserole.  Bake at 400 degrees; for 30 to 45 minutes or until cheese is brown.  Then cover and bake until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes longer.
