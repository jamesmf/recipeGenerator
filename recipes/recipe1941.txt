      Can you believe that you are making turkey with pepper and chocolate sauce?  This is actually a very old dish in Mexico.  The story goes that some nuns in a priory were suddenly informed that the bishop was coming to dinner.  The sisters had little to eat and threw together almost everything that they could get their hands on, thus the birth of this dish.  Who knows, and what's the difference?  I like that story.
