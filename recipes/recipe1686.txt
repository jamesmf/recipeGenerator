CORNED BEEF RED FLANNEL HASH


1  lb. cooked corned beef
2  medium white potatoes, boiled, peeled, and diced
1  medium onion, diced
1 (15 oz.)  can sliced beets
1  fresh jalapeno pepper, diced (optional, but if you like a little spice, the potatoes mellow it)

      Boil potatoes until tender, peel and dice.  Dice the meat. Dice the onion.  Carefully take the seeds out of the jalapeno pepper, if you are using it (I like hot food, the spice makes my saliva glands work and since they don't most of the time, I use a lot of hot spices) and chop it fine.
      Put some oil in a pan that can hold the volume of the preceding ingredients.  Add the onions and the jalapenos if you are using them.  Saut√© for a bit, until the onions begin to brown (add a little garlic at this point, if you like garlic).
      Add the rest of the ingredients, including the juice from the can of beets (this takes up the place of the cream that would make this non-kosher).
