EGG ROLLS


1  log Bob Evans sausage
1/3  c. water
1  can bamboo shoots
1  bunch scallions
1  bottle vegetable oil
1/3  c. flour
1  bottle teriyaki sauce
1  can water chestnuts
1  pkg. egg roll wrappers

      Brown sausage in frying pan.  Drain off grease.  Cut up veggies and mix in with cooked sausage; add a touch of salt and as much teriyaki sauce as desired.  Mix well.  Lay egg roll wrapper out flat; mix the water and flour to make a paste and smooth around edges of wrapper.  Put tablespoon of mixture into wrapper and roll it up.
      Heat oil (enough to cover egg roll) in wok or pan.  When heated, drop egg roll in and cook until wrapper is brown.  Take out of oil and drain excess oil off the egg roll.
