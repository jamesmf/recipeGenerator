CHICKEN PESTO PITA PIZZAS


1 12  oz. bag frozen Fully Cooked Chicken Breast Fajitas
6  KRONOS Authentic Pita flat breads
2/3  c. regular or reduced fat mayonnaise
2  Tbsp. Racconto Traditional Basil Pesto
1 14  oz. can Reese Quartered Artichoke Hearts, drained
1 6  oz. jar Harvest Moon Sliced Mushrooms, drained
1  small red bell pepper, seeds removed
2  c. shredded four cheese pizza blend

      Heat oven to 450 degrees.  Place 2 oven racks in bottom half of oven.  Remove fajitas from packaging and place in a microwave safe dish.  Heat on HIGH power until pieces begin to thaw; stir and rearrange fajitas in dish as necessary.  Pull apart to separate; tear or cut chicken into bite-sized pieces.  Meanwhile, line 2 large baking sheets with foil.  Lay 3 pita shells on each baking sheet.  Combine mayonnaise with pesto; spread evenly over tops of pita bread, about 2 tablespoons on each.  Place chicken, artichoke hearts, and mushrooms over pesto layer.  Cut pepper into thin strips; lay strips over tops of pizzas and sprinkle evenly with cheese, 1/3 cup over each pizza.  Bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until cheese melts and begins to brown.  Let stand 2 to 3 minutes, cut into slices and serve.
