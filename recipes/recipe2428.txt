CHRISTMAS ANGEL CAKE


1  pkg. Duncan Hines angel food cake mix
2 (10 oz.)  pkg. frozen sliced strawberries, thawed
1  pkg. strawberry flavored gelatin
1  c. hot water
  confectioners sugar

      You will need cardboard.
      Day Before:  Prepare angel cake mix as label directs, baking it in an ungreased 10-inch tube pan.  Cool cake as directed, then store, carefully covered.
      Drain thawed strawberries, reserving the syrup (about 1 to 1 1/4 cups).  Dissolve gelatin in hot water, then stir in reserved strawberry syrup.  Refrigerate until slightly thickened, about 1 hour.  Fold drained berries into this mixture.  Refrigerate until almost set, about 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
      Meanwhile, with serrated knife, cut inverted angel cake crosswise into 3 even layers; place bottom layer on cake plate. Over it, spread half of strawberry-gelatin mixture almost to edge. Adjust second layer, top side up.  Over it, spread rest of gelatin mixture.  Cover with top layer.  Refrigerate.
      From cardboard, cut eight 2-inch stars, then lay them, in a circle, around center top of cake.  Now generously sprinkle top and sides of cake with confectioners sugar.  Carefully lift off cardboard stars, leaving star pattern on cake.  Refrigerate cake about 1/2 hour or until ready to serve.  Serve in small wedges. Makes 10 to 12 servings.
      This is a beautiful cake, with the red strawberry mixture shimmering through the white confectioners sugar.
