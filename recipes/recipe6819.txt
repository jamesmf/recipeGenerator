SPANISH RICE (BEEF AND RICE CASSEROLE)


1  lb. 90% lean ground beef
1  can stewed tomatoes (undrained)
1  can cut green beans (undrained)
1  c. rice
1/2  tsp. dry mustard
1/8 to 1/4  tsp. garlic powder
1  Tbsp. minced onion
1  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
1  Tbsp. sugar
1/2  tsp. fresh ground pepper
1  red pepper, chopped (I added this part)

      In at least a 2 1/2-quart microproof dish with cover, crumble beef and cook on High for 3 minutes.  Stir and cook for 3 more minutes.  Drain if you wish.  Make sure the cooked meat is crumbled well.  Add remaining ingredients and cut up the tomatoes and stir. Microwave on High for 10 minutes.  Stir and cook on 20% for 10 minutes.  Stir and cook on 70% for 5 to 6 minutes or until liquid is absorbed and rice is soft.  Let stand for a few minutes before eating or you might burn the roof of your mouth.
