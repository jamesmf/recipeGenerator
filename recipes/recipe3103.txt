MINI POTATO SKINS


24  small red potatoes
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. black pepper
2  c. shredded Cheddar cheese
8  green onions, chopped

      Preheat oven to 450 degrees;. Scrub the potatoes thoroughly. Using a fork, prick potatoes in several places. Place potatoes on a baking sheet. Bake until tender, about 35 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to wire rack and allow potatoes to cool before handling.
      Cut potatoes in half and scoop out most of the flesh, taking care not to break the skins. Cut each potato skin in half again lengthwise, for a total of 4 pieces from each whole potato.
       Place skins on a lightly greased baking sheet; sprinkle evenly with salt and pepper. Bake until potato skins are browned around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle Cheddar and green onions over skins. Return to oven and bake 3 to 4 minutes.
