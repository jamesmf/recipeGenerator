FRIDAY NIGHT PIZZA

Dough:
1  c. scalded milk
1/4  c. ice cold water
3  c. white flour
1 1/2  Tbsp. sugar
1  tsp. salt
3  tsp. yeast or 2 tsp. fast rising yeast

      Place 1 cup of milk in microwave for 3 minutes. Add ice water. Put in freezer to cool. Mix flour, sugar, salt and yeast. (You can use your bread maker, a Kitchen Aid mixer or just a wooden spoon and your hands to mix the dough.) Once the milk/water mixture is cool enough, add gradually to the dough. Knead very thoroughly. Let rise in a warm place for 1 hour. Grease a cookie sheet or a pizza pan. Roll out the dough on a floured surface. Form a pizza crust with your hands by tossing it while stretching the dough. Stretch to fit your pizza pan or a large cookie sheet. Make sauce after you've formed your crust on your pan.
Sauce:
1 small  can tomato paste
1/2 small  can of water
1  tsp. garlic powder
1  tsp. onion powder
1/2  tsp. basil

      Mix well. You can melt butter and garlic and spread evenly on your crust. Or you can spread olive oil on your crust mixed with basil or garlic or whatever sounds good to you or you can just leave the crust dry if you're watching calories! Spread pizza sauce evenly onto pizza.
       Toppings are up to you. I use Mozzarella, onions, tomatoes, peppers, ham, olives or whatever I have on hand. I've even tried fresh spinach and it was yummy! Pepperoni is always a plus! The possibilities are endless!
