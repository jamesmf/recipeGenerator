LEMON CHICKEN PRIMAVERA


1  Tbsp. butter or margarine
1  lb. boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into strips
1 (10 1/2 oz.)  can chicken gravy
1  (16 oz.) bag frozen vegetable combination
3  cloves garlic, minced
2  Tbsp. lemon juice
1/2  tsp. dried basil leaves, crushed
1/8  tsp. pepper
4  c. hot cooked spaghetti (about 8 oz. dry)

      In a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat, in hot margarine cook half of the chicken until browned, stirring often. Remove and set aside. Repeat with remaining chicken.
      In the same skillet, combine gravy, vegetables, garlic, lemon juice, basil and pepper. Heat to boiling. Reduce heat to low.
