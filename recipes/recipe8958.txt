LITTLE BEEF ROLLS


1  round steak (about 1/2-inch thick)
  bacon (several strips)
1  can mushroom soup

      Trim round steak of all fat. Cut into strips, about 1 1/2 x 3-inches. Salt and pepper meat. Place a sliver of garlic and a very small piece of bacon on meat. Roll up and secure with a toothpick. Roll in flour and brown in melted shortening. After all rolls are browned, drain off all fat from pan. Push meat aside and pour in mushroom soup. Add 1 can of water. Cover and cook over low heat until tender, about 1 hour, scraping bottom of skillet to keep from sticking. Add water when necessary. Very good served with mashed potatoes.
