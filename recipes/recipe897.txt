SEAFOOD AND BASIL PHYLLO


1/4  lb. shrimp, cooked, shelled and chopped
6  Tbsp. Parmesan cheese
1 1/2  Tbsp. dried basil
6  oz. cream cheese
2  Tbsp. dry sherry
  few shakes nutmeg
1/4  lb. crabmeat
1/2  lb. phyllo
1/4 to 1/2  lb. butter

      Process first 7 ingredients in food processor.  Cut phyllo lengthwise into 4 strips.  Place on damp cloth and cover with wax paper to prevent sheets from drying out.  Working with 1 or 2 strips at a time, brush with melted butter.  Fold over about 1/4-inch from the bottom edge.  Add a spoonful of filling just above fold and fold again to form a triangle.  Continue folding as if you were folding an American flag.  Place seam side down on baking sheets.  When all triangles have been made, brush tops with melted butter.  Bake at 400 degrees; for 20 to 30 minutes, until tops are browned.  Freeze or refrigerate, if desired.
      To serve:  Defrost (if frozen) and reheat at 350 degrees; for 10 to 15 minutes.
