SEVEN-LAYER CASSEROLE


1 1/2  c. cooked rice
1 1/2  c. cubed ham
1/2  onion, chopped or 2 to 3 green onions, chopped
1 1/2  c. chopped broccoli, cooked and drained
1 (10 oz.)  can cream of mushroom soup
1 1/2  c. shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/4  c. milk
2  slices sourdough bread
2  Tbsp. butter or margarine

      In a buttered 1 1/2-quart casserole, layer rice, ham, onion and broccoli.
       In separate bowl, combine soup, cheese and milk. Spread over broccoli. Bake at 375 degrees; for 20 minutes.
       Meanwhile, make coarse bread crumbs in a blender with bread slices. Saut crumbs in butter over medium-high heat until light brown, stirring frequently. Sprinkle crumbs over casserole. Continue baking 15 minutes longer or until hot and bubbly. Good served with fresh fruit and crusty hot rolls.
      Tips:  If you wish, 1 package (10 ounce), frozen chopped broccoli, cooked and drained may be used instead of fresh.  To make 1 1/2 cups cooked rice, use 1/2 cup raw long-grain rice and 1 cup water.

      For 8 Servings: Double the ingredients. Use a 2-quart casserole. Increase baking time to 40 minutes.
