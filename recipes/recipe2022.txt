BUTTERSCOTCH BRITTLE


1  c. sugar
1  c. butter (do not substitute margarine)
1  pkg. butterscotch morsels (6 oz.)
  nuts

      Cook sugar and butter over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the candy thermometer registers 310 degrees;.  Immediately remove from heat and spread quickly on a large cookie sheet that has been covered with foil.  Pour a package of butterscotch morsels over the top of candy and spread with a knife.  Sprinkle with finely chopped nuts.  Recipe may be doubled.  Important:  You must work fast spreading the candy onto the cookie sheet and also spreading the morsels on top while the mixture is hot.  Delicious!  Enjoy!
