CHEESE AND MEAT ENCHILADAS


1 to 1 1/2  lb. ground beef
1  large onion, diced
2  to 3 medium sized tomatoes, diced
2 small  cans tomato sauce
4 small  cans water
  salt and pepper to taste
  garlic salt or small clove
  cooking oil
  pkg. corn tortillas
  Cheddar cheese, shredded
  Mozzarella cheese, shredded
  sprig of fresh cilantro, chopped

	Brown ground beef; drain.  Add 2/3 cup onions; cook until onions are soft. Add tomatoes; stir well and continue cooking for a few minutes.  Add tomato sauce and water (this will make plenty of sauce). Add seasoning. Simmer, cooking sauce down so that it is not too liquidy.  Reserve 1 to 2 cups of sauce for topping.
	In small frying pan, heat enough oil to cover bottom of pan. Place tortillas, one at a time, in the hot oil and fry.  Tortilla should be soft, not crispy. You must be able to roll it up. Remove from pan onto paper towels and pat to remove excess oil.
	Preheat oven to 375 degrees;.  Spray a 9 x 13 casserole dish with Pam. Place tortilla one at a time in the dish and fill with couple spoons of meat filling; roll up and slide to end of the dish with seam side to the bottom of the dish.  Continue the process until the entire dish has a single layer.  Keep each enchilada tight to keep from unfolding.  You may need to arrange additional enchiladas along the top side of the dish.  Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove from oven and spread remaining sauce over top and sides of enchiladas. Sprinkle remaining onion evenly over enchiladas.  Return to oven for 10 minutes or until onions are browned.  Remove from oven; sprinkle Cheddar cheese and then Mozzarella evenly over the enchiladas, giving a contrast of yellow base and white topping. Return to oven and bake until cheese is melted and bubbling.
	 For a touch of Mexico, add sprigs of cilantro to decorate the enchiladas. Makes 16 or so enchiladas depending on filling thickness.
