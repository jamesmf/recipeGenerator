PARMESAN BAKED CATFISH


1  c. Ritz crackers, finely crushed
  salt and pepper to taste
1  Tbsp. parsley
1/4  tsp. cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes
5  or 6 catfish fillets
1  stick butter, melted
1/2  c. Parmesan cheese

	Preheat oven to 400 degrees;.  You will need two shallow dishes.
	 Combine the first 4 ingredients in one shallow dish and mix well. Put the melted butter in another shallow dish. Dip the fillets in the butter and then into the cracker mixture, coating each fillet very well.
	 Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray it with nonstick vegetable oil. Place each fillet on the foil and bake 20 minutes or until fish is golden brown.  Remove from oven and immediately sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
