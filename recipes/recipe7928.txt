CHILI CHICKEN


3  lbs. boneless chicken, cut in small pieces
1 (16 oz.)  can tomato puree
1  large green pepper, cut into length-wise strips
3  Tbsp. soy sauce, divided
3  Tbsp. green chili sauce, divided
1  Tbsp. vinegar
1/2  Tbps. ginger-garlic paste
  2-3 Tbsp. cornstarch
  Cayenne pepper, to taste
  Salt, to taste
  Curry leaves
  Oil for cooking

      In a large bowl, mix the chicken with half of the tomato puree,  ginger-garlic paste, 2 Tbsp. soy sauce, vinegar, 2 Tbsp. green chili sauce, cayenne and salt.  Marinate for 3 to 4 hours.
      Coat the marinated chicken with 2 to 3 Tbsp. cornstarch. Separate the marinade from the chicken and reserve.  Pan-fry the chicken with curry leaves until medium-brown.
      In a separate saucepan, heat the remaining tomato puree with 1 Tbsp. soy sauce, 1 Tbsp. green chili sauce, and any remaining marinade.  Cook slowly for about 10 minutes.
      In another pan, stir-fry the green pepper strips just until they change color.  Arrange the chicken on a baking pan, pour sauce over it, and top with green peppers.  Bake for 15 minutes.
