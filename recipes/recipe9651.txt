HAWAIIAN CHICKEN WINGS


1/4  c. butter or margarine
1/2  c. tomato ketchup
1  clove garlic, minced
3  lb. chicken wings, tips removed
1  c. fine dry bread crumbs
1 (14 oz.)  can pineapple chunks
2  Tbsp. brown sugar
1  Tbsp. minced fresh ginger (I use a tsp. of dry)
1  Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
  Dash Tabasco

      Melt butter in shallow baking pan in 400 degree oven. Stir together ketchup & garlic; brush over wings, then roll wings in bread crumbs to coat evenly. Place in pan, turning to coat lightly with butter and bake for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, drain pineapple, reserving juice in 2-cup measure; add water to make 3/4 cup liquid. Stir in brown sugar, ginger, Worcestershire sauce & Tabasco. After wings have cooked 30 minutes, turn and pour on sauce; bake about 20 to 30 minutes longer or until chicken is tender, adding pineapple for last 5 minutes. Care should be taken to ensure wings are lightly browned. Makes about 4 servings.
