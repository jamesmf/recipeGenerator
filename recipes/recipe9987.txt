SWEET PEAS


1  onion, chopped fine
3  Tbsp. cooking oil
2  Tbsp. flour (all-purpose)
3  cans small peas
1  tsp. sugar (to each can of peas)
1  to 2 potatoes, cut up

	Put oil and flour in pot to make roux; brown roux, then add chopped onions and cook until clear. Add peas with water to pot. In each can, fill 3/4 way with water and 1 teaspoon sugar and stir well, then add to pot. When gravy starts to get thick, add potatoes and lower the fire. You might have to add a little more water to finish potatoes. Serve over hot rice.
