MAC AND CHEESE


1  lb. macaroni, cooked
1  jar Ragu 5 cheese sauce
1  can cream mushroom
1  (6 oz.) sharp Cheddar cheese
1  (6 oz.) Monterey Jack and Colby
6  oz. Velveeta cheese
1/2  can milk
  butter

      Drain cooked macaroni; add 2 tablespoons butter.  Mix.  Put in 9 x 11 baking dish.  In saucepan, mix all other ingredients; heat until cheeses are all melted.  Pour over macaroni.  Top with Velveeta slices and bake at 350 degrees; for 30 minutes.  I like my cheese a little on the brown side.
