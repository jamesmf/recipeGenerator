SHRIMP PIZZA


12  oz. cream cheese, softened
1  Tbsp. lemon juice
  dash of Tabasco
1  small onion, grated
2  tsp. Worcestershire sauce
  dash of garlic salt
1  bottle chili sauce
2  cans small shrimp, drained

      With a mixer, combine cream cheese, lemon juice, Tabasco, onion, Worcestershire sauce and garlic salt.  Spread this mixture with a spatula on a platter or large round plate (like a crust). Pour chili sauce over cream cheese "crust" and spread evenly. Sprinkle the shrimp on top, forming the 3rd layer of your pizza. Serve with crackers - we love Sociables crackers.  Can be made the night before.
