1  lb. ground meat
2  Tbsp. chopped onion
3/4  tsp. salt
16  oz. can tomato sauce
2  c. grated cheese
4  c. taco flavored tortilla chips (if using plain or cheese flavored chips, use some chili powder)

      Cook beef in skillet for 5 minutes or until done.  Add onion, salt and tomato sauce.  Simmer for about 5 minutes.  If adding chili powder, do so now.
