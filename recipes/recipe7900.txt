CHICKEN AND SPAGHETTI IN HOT PEANUT SAUCE


3  Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. soy sauce
2  Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. lime juice
1  Tbsp. sesame oil
4  cloves garlic, minced
3/4  tsp. ground ginger
3 boneless chicken breasts, about 1  lb. in all
1/2  cup chunky peanut butter
2  cups low-sodium chicken broth
1/2  tsp. sugar
1/2  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. dried red pepper flakes
3/4  lb. spaghetti
3  scallions, including green tops, chopped
1/3  cup peanuts, chopped

      In a medium, shallow glass dish or stainless-steel pan, combine the 3 Tbsp. soy sauce, the 2 Tbsp. lime juice, 1 Tbsp. sesame oil and the garlic/ginger.  Add the chicken; turn to coat. Let marinate at least 10 minutes.
      Meanwhile, in a medium, stainless-steel saucepan, combine the remaining 1 tsp. soy sauce and 2 tsp. lime juice, the peanut butter, broth, sugar, salt, and red pepper flakes.  Pour the marinade from the chicken into the saucepan and bring just to a simmer over moderate heat, whisking until smooth.
      Heat a grill pan over moderate heat.  Cook the chicken until browned and just done, 4-5 minutes per side.  Remove the chicken from the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes.  Cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices.  Alternatively, heat the remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a heavy frying pan.  Cook and slice chicken in the same way.
      In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the spaghetti until just done, about 12 minutes.  Drain the pasta and toss with the peanut sauce, chicken, and scallions.  Top with the chopped peanuts.
