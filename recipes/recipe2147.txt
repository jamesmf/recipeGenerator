COFFEE-WALNUT FUDGE
(Microwave Recipe)  

3  c. sugar
1  c. half and half
3  Tbsp. light corn syrup
1/4  tsp. salt
1  Tbsp. instant coffee powder
2  tsp. hot water
4  Tbsp. butter (1/2 stick)
1/4  tsp. vanilla
1  c. walnuts, coarsely chopped

      About 1 1/2 hours before serving or day ahead:  In 5-quart glass or glass-ceramic casserole, combine sugar, half and half, syrup and salt.  Cook on High 5 to 7 minutes until mixture comes to a full boil, stirring occasionally.  Set microwave-safe candy thermometer in place.  Continue to cook on High 7 to 10 minutes or until temperature reaches 240 degrees; or soft ball stage (when a small amount of mixture dropped into a bowl of cold water forms a soft ball that flattens on removal from water).
      Dissolve coffee in hot water; add coffee mixture, butter and vanilla to hot candy mixture, but do not stir.  Cool without stirring to 110 degrees; or until outside of casserole feels lukewarm.  Meanwhile, lightly butter an 8-inch square baking pan.
      When mixture is cool, with wooden spoon, beat until fudge becomes thick and begins to lose its gloss.  Stir in nuts.  Pour fudge into prepared pan (do not scrape casserole; mixture on side may be sugary).  Chill.  When firm, cut into 6 strips, then cut each strip crosswise into 6 pieces.  Makes about 2 pounds of fudge or 36 pieces; 110 calories each.
