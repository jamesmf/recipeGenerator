EASTER BRAID


4  c. unbleached flour
1  oz. cake yeast
3  large eggs
4  Tbsp. sweet butter
1/2  c. sugar
1/4  tsp. salt
2/3  c. buttermilk
1/2  tsp. baking soda
  grated rind of 1/2 lemon (optional)
  raisins (optional)

      Food processor method:  Place flour, sugar, salt and baking soda in bowl.  Process 3 seconds.  Stir yeast with 1/2 teaspoon sugar and 1 tablespoon of water to a smooth mixture and let proof. Melt butter and let cool.  Put the eggs, butter and buttermilk on top of dry ingredients.  Process a few seconds.  Add proofed yeast. Process 30 seconds.
      Put dough on countertop and verify texture.  You may want to knead a little extra flour into it.  Let dough rise for 1 hour. Punch down.  Divide dough into 3 parts.  Roll parts out into strands, tapering ends.  Make a braid from the 3 strands.  You can start at one end or in the middle, depending a little on the length of your strands.  Place braid on baking sheet; brush with melted butter and let rise again for at least 1 hour.  Brush with milk or egg wash and bake 30 minutes in moderate oven or until medium to dark brown.
      If you use the raisins, knead them into the dough by hand.  The blade will cut them into unsightly pieces.
