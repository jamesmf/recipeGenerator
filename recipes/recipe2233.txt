SPICED PUMPKIN BUTTER


1 (29 oz.)  can solid pack pumpkin puree
3/4  c. packed light brown sugar
3/4  c. honey
1  tsp. ground cinnamon
3/4  tsp. ground ginger

      In pan, whisk all ingredients until combined.  Bring to a simmer; reduce heat to low.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes (until thick enough to hold shape on spoon).  As mixture thickens, stir more frequently to prevent scorching.  Store in airtight container in refrigerator.
