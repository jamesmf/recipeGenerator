APPLE ROLY POLY


5  large tart apples
2  c. biscuit mix
1/2  c. honey
3/4  tsp. cinnamon
1/8  tsp. cloves
1/4  tsp. nutmeg
3  Tbsp. sugar
2  Tbsp. butter

      Peel, core and finely chop apples.  Prepare biscuit mix as directed on package.  On lightly floured board, roll dough into oblong (approximately 10 x 12-inches), about 1/4-inch thick. Spread with honey to within 1-inch of the edges of the dough. Combine the spices and sugar; toss with apples.  Spread apples evenly over the honey.  Dot apples with butter.  Fold up like a jellyroll; seal well.  Bake in a greased pan with sides, at 350 degrees; for 40 minutes.  Slice and serve hot with whipped cream.
