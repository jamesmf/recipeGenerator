SWEET ITALIAN SPAGHETTI


16  oz. pasta (My preference is Angel Hair)
1  Tbsp. butter
1  lb. ground turkey or beef
  Seasonings for ground turkey (Accent, Mrs. Dash, Season All, Pepper and Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce)
3  Dino's Sweet Italian Sausages
32  oz. jar Ragu Robusto! Sweet Italian Sausage and Cheese Pasta Sauce
1  pkg. McCormick Italian-Style Spaghetti Sauce Mix
1  c. water

      Bring 5 qts. water to a boil, add pasta and stir.  Boil 10 minutes or to desired tenderness stirring occasionally. Drain, rinse, add butter, stir until butter melts and set aside.  Boil Dino Sausages approx. 20 minutes.  Peel skin and set aside.  Brown and season (to your preference) ground turkey or beef. Drain and simmer, adding Ragu sauce, McCormick sauce mix and water. Cut/chop Dino Sausages into 1/2 inch slices.  Add Dino Sausages to spaghetti sauce and simmer for additional 5 minutes.
