FISH CHOWDER


2 1/2  lb. haddock or chowder fish
2  c. water
1/4  lb. butter (more 1/2 lb.)
1 3/4  c. thinly sliced onions
2  Tbsp. flour
2 1/2  c. cubed potatoes
2  c. celery, chopped coarsely
1  bay leaf, quartered
2 1/2  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. Accent
1/4  tsp. pepper
4  c. milk
1  c. medium cream (I use heavy)
1  c. sour cream (I use 1 small or large container)

      Simmer fish with water for 5 minutes or until fish can be flaked. Remove fish. Boil fish broth 10 minutes or until reduced to about 1 2/3 cups. Remove skin, unless you buy skinless haddock and cool fish. Saut onions in 5 tablespoons butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in flour. Gradually add fish broth. Add potatoes, celery, seasonings and about 2/3 cup of fish. Simmer 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Scald milk. Remove from heat. Add cream and sour cream. (Bring the cream and sour cream to room temperature or they'll curdle.) Beat with a wire whip until creams are well combined. Reheat slowly; don't boil. Add potatoes and fish mixture to the milk mixture. Heat 5 minutes. Remove loose bay leaves. Top with butter. Best heated next day. Makes 3 quarts.
