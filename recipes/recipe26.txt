CHOCOLATE TEDDY BEARS


2/3  c. butter or margarine
1  c. sugar
2  tsp. vanilla
2  eggs
2 1/2  c. unsifted flour
1/2  c. unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2  tsp. baking soda
1/4  tsp. salt

      Cream together the butter, sugar and vanilla in a large bowl. Add eggs and beat well.  Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.  Add to the butter mixture and blend.  Chill until dough is firm enough to handle.  To shape teddy bears:  Form a portion of dough into a large ball for body (1-inch), 1 medium ball for head, 4 small balls for arms and legs (1/2-inch), 2 smaller balls for ears, 1 tiny ball for nose and 4 tiny balls for paws.
      On ungreased cookie sheet, flatten the large ball slightly for body.  Attach medium ball for head by overlapping slightly onto body.  Place balls for arms, legs and ears and flatten; add a tiny ball on head for nose.  Arrange other tiny balls atop ends of legs and arms for paws.  With a wooden toothpick, draw eyes and mouth. Bake at 350 degrees; for 6 to 8 minutes or until set.
