RICH YEAST ROLLS


1  c. milk, scalded
1/3  c. shortening (part or all butter)
1/2  c. sugar
1 1/2  tsp. salt
2  cakes compressed yeast
1/2  c. lukewarm water
  about 5 c. all-purpose flour, sifted
2  eggs, beaten

      Combine scalded milk, shortening, sugar and salt; cool to lukewarm.  Soften yeast in lukewarm water; stir and combine with cooled milk mixture.  Add about half the flour; add the beaten eggs and beat well.  Add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough; mix thoroughly.  Turn out on lightly floured board and knead about 10 minutes or until smooth and satiny.
      Place dough in a warm greased bowl; brush surface very lightly with melted shortening.  Cover and let rise in a warm place (80 degrees; to 85 degrees;) about 2 hours or until doubled in bulk.  Turn out on a board and shape into rolls as directed next.
      Use a biscuit cutter for cutting them or make Parker House rolls by rolling small balls about 1-inch and putting 3 of them in a greased muffin pan.  Place on a greased baking sheet; cover and let rise 1/2 to 3/4 hour or until doubled in bulk.  Brush with milk, melted shortening, diluted egg white or diluted egg yolk. Bake in a moderate oven at 375 degrees; for 15 to 20 minutes.
