HONEY-MUSTARD CHICKEN


1/3  c. Dijon mustard
1/3  c. honey
2  Tbsp. chopped, fresh dill or 1 Tbsp. dried dill
1  tsp. freshly grated orange peel
1  (2 1/2 lb.) chicken, quartered

      Make Ahead:  Make the honey-mustard sauce ahead of time as directed in step 1. Keep refrigerated until ready to use. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
      1.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees;. Combine mustard and honey in a small bowl; stir in dill and orange peel.
      2. Line a baking sheet with foil.  Place chicken, side side down, on prepared pan.  Brush sauce on top of chicken; coat well.
      3. Turn chicken over.  Gently pull back skin and brush meat with sauce.  Gently pull skin back over sauce.
      4. Brush skin with remaining sauce.  Bake until juices run clear when thickest portion of meat is pierced with a knife, about 30 minutes.  Serves 4.
      Cook'n Xpress:  For an even speedier meal, use skinless chicken breasts. Broil chicken, turning once, until no longer pink, about 15 minutes. Make measuring honey easier by spraying the measuring cup with vegetable cooking spray. The honey will not stick to the cup.
