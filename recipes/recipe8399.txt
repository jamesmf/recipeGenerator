CHICKEN DE NORMANDY


1  pkg. seasoned cornbread stuffing
1  stick melted butter
1  c. chicken broth
3  c. broiled, diced chicken
1/2  c. chopped onion
1/2  c. green onion tips or chives
1/2  c. chopped celery
1/2  c. mayonnaise
1  tsp. salt
2  eggs
1  c. milk
1  can cream of mushroom soup
2  c. grated cheese

      Mix stuffing, butter and broth.  Put half of mixture in bottom of a 9 x 13 casserole dish. Mix remaining ingredients together, except cheese and place on stuffing.  Then, place remaining stuffing on top and cover with cheese.  Bake at 325 degrees; for 40 minutes.  May want to wait until last 10 minutes to put cheese on top.  You can make ahead and put in refrigerator.  Let sit out 1 hour before baking.
