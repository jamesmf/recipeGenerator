RED BELL PEPPER SOUP


2  large red bell peppers
1  onion, chopped
1  c. grated carrots
1/4  c. butter
1/4  c. flour
2  c. chicken bouillon (can use 1 can chicken broth)
2  c. half and half cream (can use fat-free if desired)
1 (15 oz.)  can tomato sauce
1/4  tsp. hot chili flakes or drops of hot sauce to taste
  Salt and pepper to taste

      Rinse peppers and cut in half and seed.  Lay cut sides down on a cookie sheet.  Broil 4 - 6 inches from heat until skins are blackened all over  (about 12 min., but keep close watch on them). Remove from oven and place in brown paper bag and close the bag. They will steam in the bag.  After about 10 min., remove them, and remove the skin from the peppers.  Chop up the peppers and set aside.  Stir onions, carrots, and butter for 3 min. in your soup pot and then stir in the chopped peppers.  Add flour, and stir one minute.  Add broth, half & half, and tomato sauce.  Stir and mix well and let it cook approx. 10 min. until it boils and is thickened.  Stir in hot flakes or hot sauce drops and salt and pepper.
      NOTE:  This can be made ahead to have in the refrigerator. Just heat slowly when ready to serve it.  It will serve 6 - 8 people depending upon serving sizes.
