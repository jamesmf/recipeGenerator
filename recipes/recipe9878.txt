MAMA'S FRIED GREEN TOMATOES


3/4  c. flour
1/4  c. cornmeal
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  tsp. pepper
3/4  c. milk
4  green tomatoes, cut 1/4-inch thick
  buttermilk or Ranch dressing (for dipping)

      Mix first 5 ingredients. Dip tomatoes in batter. Fry in 2-inches of hot oil (375 degrees;). Turn once during browning. Don't drain on paper; it makes them soggy.
      Mama's special touch: Add a little bacon fat in oil. Good eatin.
