ORANGE AND ALMOND CHICKEN


1  (2 to 3 lb.) broiler-fryer, cut up
1/2  c. finely chopped blanched almonds
1  tsp. dried rosemary, crumbled
3  Tbsp. butter, softened
2  Tbsp. finely minced shallots or onion
  grated rind of 1 orange
1  tsp. salt
1/8  tsp. pepper

      Prepare grill at least 1/2 hour before cooking time.  Adjust grid 6 to 8 inches above the coals.  Rinse chicken parts; pat dry. In small bowl, blend ingredients to form a paste.  Gently lift chicken skin; spread paste as evenly as possible between skin and meat.  Place chicken skin-side up on grill.  Grill 20 to 30 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink when cut near bone.  Turn chicken once, halfway through cooking period.  Serves 4.
