CABBAGE UNROLLED


1  small head cabbage, coarsely chopped (about 1 lb.)
1  lb. lean ground beef
1/2  c. instant rice (uncooked)
1  small onion, finely chopped
1/2  tsp. salt (optional)
1/8  tsp. black pepper
1 (15 oz.)  can tomato puree
1 (14 1/2 oz.)  can beef broth

	Place 1/3 of the cabbage in the bottom of a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven. In bowl, combine rice, beef, onion, salt and pepper. Form into meatballs. Place half of the meatballs on top of the cabbage. Cover with 1/3 of the cabbage and the rest of the meatballs. Top with the remaining 1/3 of the cabbage. Pour tomato puree and beef broth over all. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, 20 minutes or until meat is cooked through.
