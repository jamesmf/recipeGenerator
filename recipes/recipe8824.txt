VENISON SAUSAGE


5  lb. venison, with fat trimmed off
2  lb. fresh side pork
1  lb. beef fat
7  tsp. salt
4  tsp. black pepper
3  tsp. sage
2  tsp. thyme
1  tsp. nutmeg
1/2  tsp. cayenne pepper
1  bay leaf, crushed

      Chill all meat so it will grind better. Cut venison and pork into 1-inch cubes and spread on a large cookie sheet. Grind beef fat through 3/8-inch plate and spread over the cubed venison and pork. Mix salt and other spices in a tightly covered jar, then sprinkle over meat mixture. Grind entire mixture, using 3/16-inch plate on a grinder, then mix thoroughly with your hands.
